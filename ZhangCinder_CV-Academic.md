## RESEARCH FOCUS

**Human-AI Partnership in Professional Cognition**

My research investigates how professionals develop expertise when AI systems can perform expert-level tasks. This work sits at the intersection of finance, cognitive science, and AI systems design.

*Core Research Questions:*
- How do humans develop systematic thinking when AI can provide answers instantly?
- What cognitive capabilities remain distinctively valuable in AI-augmented environments?
- How should professional education transform when the knowledge it transmits becomes freely available through AI?

*Methodology:* Design science research — engineering interventions, deploying at scale, studying outcomes empirically. The DRIVER Framework represents the first systematically engineered learning system for human-AI partnership in professional domains, currently deployed with 280+ participants generating longitudinal qualitative data.

## RESEARCH IN PROGRESS

### AI and Financial Analysis

**"The Rise of Generative AI in Financial Analysis: Evidence from Equity Research"**  
with Austin Francis  
*Status: Revise and Resubmit, Finance Research Letters*

We demonstrate that AI agentic research teams can match or exceed human equity analysts in comprehensive investment research. Analysis of 50 matched-pair company reports shows AI-generated reports significantly outperform human reports in quality scores (mean difference = 0.272, t-stat = 3.17, p < 0.01). This documents a fundamental transformation: cognitive computing systems can now replicate core intellectual tasks previously exclusive to human professionals.

*Implication:* If AI can do what we trained professionals to do, how to reinvent professional education with human-AI partnership?

### The DRIVER Framework: Human Cognition in AI-Augmented Environments

**"Systematic Human-AI Partnership in Professional Learning"**  
*Status: Active research program with ongoing data collection*

DRIVER (Discover & Design, Represent, Implement, Validate, Evolve, Reflect) is the first engineered system for developing systematic thinkers in AI-augmented professional environments. Unlike theoretical proposals, DRIVER is deployed and generating empirical data.

**Current Implementation Scale:**
- 280+ participants across multiple cohorts
- AI in Finance, AI Leadership in Finance, Financial Modeling, Financial Data Analytics, Financial Management courses
- Following semesters: Expansion to more students

**Research Design:**
- Three-point longitudinal survey capturing cognitive development trajectory
- Survey 1 (Week 3-4): Baseline state and initial responses to AI integration
- Survey 2 (Week 8-9): Emerging cognitive shifts and mindset changes
- Survey 3 (Week 16): Full-semester reflection on transformation

**Preliminary Findings:**

*Documented cognitive shift:* Students move from treating AI as "answer machine" to describing it as "thinking partner requiring skill."

Representative trajectory from participant data:
> Survey 1: "I was very confused on what the class is even about, why we are coding"
> Survey 2: "I've learned that effectively using AI isn't about seeking answers, but about using it to think"

*Emerging research questions from data:*
- Does AI-augmented learning build or erode foundational cognitive capacity?
- Who transforms under DRIVER and who resists? What predicts the difference?
- How do "productive struggle" levels affect cognitive development with AI support?
- Do cognitive shifts persist beyond the intervention?

**Validation Evidence:**
- Teaching evaluations: 73rd-82nd percentile rankings
- Student testimonials in anonymous teaching evaluation: "This class should be the gold standard for all of Purdue"
- Career outcomes: Graduates placed at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, State Street, MasterCard, EY, Walmart Global Tech

### Other Working Papers

**"Loan Syndication and Bond Mutual Fund Information Flow"**  
with Xiaonan Ma and Hanjiang Zhang  
*Status: First draft, updating data*

**"Cross-Asset Return Predictability: Machine Learning and Corporate Bond-Equity Information Transfer"**  
*Status: First draft, additional robustness tests*

Documents predictability in corporate bond markets using equity-based signals through machine learning methods. Gradient boosting models achieve out-of-sample R² of 5.14% for one-month bond returns.
