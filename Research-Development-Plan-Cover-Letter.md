Dear Members of the Search Committee,

I am writing to apply for the joint faculty position between MIT Sloan and the Schwarzman College of Computing. My research addresses what may be the defining question for professional domains in the AI era: *how do humans develop expertise when AI systems can perform expert-level cognitive tasks?* This question requires both deep understanding of professional domains and rigorous engagement with AI systems—precisely the intersection a joint appointment enables. My background—Ph.D. in Finance from UNC Charlotte and B.S. in Software and Computer Science from Jilin University—combined with my current research program positions me to contribute meaningfully to both units.
**The Research Problem.** In recent work with Austin Francis (R&R at *Finance Research Letters*), we demonstrate that AI agentic research teams can match or exceed human equity analysts in comprehensive investment research (mean difference = 0.272, t = 3.17, p < 0.01). This is not merely a technological curiosity—it represents a fundamental disruption to how financial information is produced, valued, and disseminated.

The $15 billion equity research industry, the career trajectories of financial professionals, and the information architecture of capital markets all depend on assumptions about human comparative advantage in financial analysis. When those assumptions no longer hold, we face first-order questions for finance:

1. **Information Production**: How does the production function of financial analysis change when AI can replicate expert cognition? What are the implications for market efficiency when sophisticated analysis becomes democratized?

2. **Human Capital Valuation**: Which capabilities remain distinctly valuable in financial labor markets? What new competencies emerge, and what existing skills become commoditized?

3. **Engineering Best Practices**: How do we design systems—training protocols, organizational structures, collaboration frameworks—that develop human capital complementary to AI rather than redundant to it?

4. **Financial Intermediation**: What happens to the structure of financial services when the cognitive work of analysis can be automated? How do firm boundaries, compensation structures, and career paths adapt?

**DRIVER: An Empirical Laboratory for Financial Labor Market Dynamics.** Rather than theorizing about these questions, I have engineered and deployed an intervention that generates empirical data on human adaptation to AI augmentation in finance. The DRIVER Framework represents design science research—building systematic interventions, deploying at scale, and studying outcomes empirically. Current implementation spans 280+ participants with longitudinal data tracking cognitive development trajectories.

This generates testable hypotheses about financial human capital: Does structured AI collaboration build analytical capabilities or create dependency? What predicts successful adaptation versus displacement? How do different training architectures affect the development of AI-complementary skills? These questions have direct implications for how financial services firms train talent, how universities prepare students for finance careers, and how labor markets in finance will evolve.
Current implementation spans 280+ participants across multiple courses at Purdue University. A three-round longitudinal survey captures cognitive development trajectories at Weeks 3-4, 8-9, and 16, documenting how participants' mental models of AI partnership evolve throughout the intervention. Preliminary data reveals measurable cognitive shifts: participants move from treating AI as an "answer machine" to describing it as a "thinking partner requiring skill." One participant's trajectory illustrates the transformation—from "I was very confused on what the class is even about" in Week 3 to "I've learned that effectively using AI isn't about seeking answers, but about using it to think" by Week 8.

This generates rigorous research questions: Does AI-augmented professional development build or erode foundational cognitive capacity? Who transforms under structured AI partnership and who resists—and what predicts the difference? How do varying levels of "productive struggle" affect cognitive development when AI support is available? Do cognitive shifts persist beyond the intervention? These questions sit at the intersection of cognitive science, AI systems design, and professional expertise—requiring the interdisciplinary approach a joint appointment enables.

**Textbooks for the Research Infrastructure:** Three textbooks under contract with World Scientific Publishing (signed October 2025) codify the DRIVER methodology for replication across institutions, creating the foundation for multi-site research. The contracts explicitly preserve my copyright to the DRIVER methodology for unrestricted research use.

My empirical finance research provides the foundation for this work. Publications in the *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis* (fire sales and liquidity) and *Journal of Corporate Finance* (privatization and innovation), along with work in the *Journal of Banking and Finance* on bond markets, demonstrate capacity for rigorous empirical research. This record (649 Google Scholar citations, 496 since 2020) reflects sustained engagement with questions that matter to both academic and practitioner audiences. A working paper applying machine learning to cross-asset return predictability (achieving 5.14% out-of-sample R² for bond returns) demonstrates my ongoing engagement with computational methods in finance.

**Why a Joint Appointment.** The research question—how humans develop expertise alongside AI—cannot be answered from either finance or computing alone. Finance provides the professional domain where AI's cognitive capabilities can be rigorously benchmarked against human experts. Computing provides the systems understanding necessary to design and study human-AI collaboration architectures. A joint appointment enables research that neither unit could fully support independently: studying how AI systems affect human cognitive development requires both the domain expertise finance provides and the AI systems sophistication computing offers.

To carry my long term research agenda, I am prepared to research and teach across both schools. At Sloan, I can offer AI in finance and AI leadership in Finance. At Schwarzman College, I can contribute to examining AI's implications for professional expertise, human-AI collaboration systems, and the design of AI-augmented learning environments. Student feedbacks (*"This class should be the gold standard for all of Purdue"*) and student outcomes—placements at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, State Street, and MasterCard—provide evidence that this approach produces both measurable learning and career-relevant capabilities.

**Why MIT.** The Schwarzman College of Computing represents MIT's institutional commitment to understanding AI's implications for human capability and society. MIT Sloan's engagement with technology-enabled transformation provides the professional context where these questions have immediate stakes. I am drawn to MIT specifically because the institution is defining what AI means for human development—and this research contributes directly to that mission. The question of how professionals should develop when AI can perform expert-level tasks is not merely academic; it will shape how MIT trains its own students, how firms structure their workforces, and how society prepares for an AI-augmented future.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my research program could contribute to both MIT Sloan and the Schwarzman College of Computing. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Dr. Xinde (Cinder) Zhang
