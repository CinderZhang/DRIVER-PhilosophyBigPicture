# "I Learned How to Be One With AI": The 16-Week Transformation

*How students went from confusion to capability—told in their own words across three surveys*

---

Every semester, I collect student feedback at three points: early (around week 4), midway (around week 8), and at the end (week 16). What emerges is a transformation story that no single snapshot could capture.

This semester, I gathered nearly 500 responses from Financial Management students. The arc they describe—from skepticism and confusion to confidence and capability—reveals something profound about how humans learn to work with AI.

Here's their journey, in their words.

## Act I: The Confusion (Early Feedback)

The early feedback was honest and, frankly, messy:

*"Most of the time, my peers and I feel very lost during class because we do not understand what is being said."*

*"I feel like I'm not fully understanding the concepts. It's hard for me to explain the code because I don't really know how to code."*

*"The class seems more focused on the Colab and a lot of AI talk than on the actual finance side of things."*

*"I wish the course was a little more direct in explaining financial management at times."*

Students felt disoriented. The structure was unfamiliar. The integration of AI with finance felt jarring. Many wanted more traditional lectures, clearer instructions, more hand-holding.

But here's what's interesting: the confusion was the point.

The discomfort of figuring things out—of struggling before succeeding—is precisely where cognitive development happens. I wasn't teaching finance. I was teaching how to learn finance with AI as a partner.

Not everyone saw it that way at first:

*"I feel the only tangible things I have learned so far are the principle of DRIVER and that we are supposed to ask Google Gemini to solve the codes for us."*

*"AI is doing all the teaching, and no other MGMT 310 course focuses this heavily on AI."*

These critiques stung. But I held the course.

## Act II: The Shift (Mid-Semester Feedback)

By mid-semester, something changed. The same students who felt lost were describing breakthroughs:

*"Before, I used to think AI could only be used as a chatbot. Now I understand that AI can be used for so much more and can even automate tasks."*

*"My mindset completely changed. I now see AI as a real learning partner—something that can help me understand, build, and even explain financial concepts in my own words."*

*"I've learned that AI is only as useful as you know how to use it."*

The shift wasn't from hating to loving. It was from **passive consumption to active partnership.**

Students described learning to:
- Write better prompts (*"the better the prompt, the better the response"*)
- Iterate through problems (*"looping"* until outputs made sense)
- Verify AI's work (*"AI can make a lot of mistakes if you're not careful"*)
- Think alongside AI rather than outsourcing thinking to it

One student captured it perfectly:

*"At the start of the semester, I thought of AI as just a 'magic 8-ball'—a tool for getting quick answers. Now I see it as a collaborative learning partner, a 'co-pilot.' The crucial shift happened when I realized AI's strength isn't just giving answers, but helping me explore them."*

The most common phrase: **"from answer-finder to learning partner."**

## Act III: The Transformation (End-of-Semester Reflections)

The final reflections were extraordinary. Students weren't just describing what they learned—they were describing who they became.

### From Fear to Collaboration

*"When this semester started, I thought AI was something that was scary and should not be used. I didn't want to start using it because I did not know much about it at all... I was surprised the most about myself with how quickly I adjusted to using AI as a tool/helper."*

*"Before this class, I used AI without a structured way to prompt it. I was simply telling it what I needed done, but was not providing the necessary context. Now, the DRIVER framework has become my go-to prompting strategy."*

*"I now see AI differently—not as something that replaces thinking, but something that pushes me to think better."*

### From Passive to Active Learning

*"I realized that my growth did not come from immediately knowing the right answer, but from working through uncertainty and refining my thinking over time."*

*"The moment everything clicked was when I stopped using AI to 'get answers' and started using it to challenge my reasoning."*

*"Learning no longer feels like passively absorbing information; it feels like iterating, testing, and improving."*

### The "Click" Moments

Students described specific moments when everything came together:

**Mini Project breakthroughs:**
*"The big turning point was during Mini Project 2 when we used n8n. Seeing that workflow come together was the moment everything clicked—I saw it wasn't just theory anymore, but a real tool I could use."*

*"Building a financial tool myself—watching my own workflow run, with nodes and logic that I set up—made everything from earlier in the semester make sense."*

**The Time Value of Money revelation:**
*"TVM problems shifted from being formulas to being timelines—when I understood that every financial decision is just cash flows moving through time. That 'aha' moment made stocks, bonds, mortgages, and even corporate projects feel like variations of the same idea."*

**The validation shift:**
*"I realized that validation works not just as checking math, but as developing financial skepticism and testing assumptions. Suddenly, finance felt less like guessing numbers and more like telling a defendable story."*

### The Deepest Transformation

Some reflections went beyond skills to identity:

*"I have learned how to be one with AI. This is the most important thing. It isn't just software I use anymore. I don't feel alone when I don't know an answer, because I have a partner to help me figure it out."*

*"I stopped asking 'What can AI do for me?' and started asking 'What can I create with AI that's never existed before?'"*

*"My relationship with AI has evolved from dependence to collaboration—an iterative dialogue that sharpens thinking rather than replaces it."*

*"I am no longer just a student memorizing facts. I am a thinker who knows how to merge my mind with the machine to solve problems."*

## The Skeptics (And Why They Matter)

Not every student was convinced. Some maintained skepticism through all three surveys:

*"I feel like I've learned more about AI than I have about financial management. There is too much focus on the AI portion of the class."*

*"I haven't found the assignments to be particularly helpful for improving my knowledge. The whole point of the course is to get a background on finance, but because everyone uses AI, there is no point in learning the material."*

*"AI has replaced the learning... I feel the assignments should be structured differently to not include as much reliance on AI."*

These critiques raise real questions: Where's the line between AI-enhanced learning and AI-dependent shortcuts? How do we ensure students build genuine understanding, not just prompt-engineering skills?

I don't have perfect answers. But I notice something: even the skeptics described learning things they didn't expect:

*"While I still have my skepticisms regarding AI, I have learned that it can be an incredible tool if used appropriately and responsibly."*

*"No matter how much I may dislike it, the world is going to be continuing to rely more and more on AI in the near future. Having exposure to it has allowed me to be more confident with my competence of AI coming into the workforce."*

The tension is productive.

## What Students Will Carry Forward

The final question in the end-of-semester survey asked: *What will you carry forward from this experience?*

The answers reveal what actually stuck:

**The DRIVER Framework:**
*"I will carry forward the DRIVER framework. After doing so many projects that involved this mindset and structure, it will be hard to forget the steps."*

*"DRIVER gave me a way to break big problems into steps I can handle."*

**The Mindset Shift:**
*"I'll carry forward the belief that progress starts with a rough draft—whether it's code, a model, or a financial analysis."*

*"I'm taking away the confidence that even if I don't know something yet, I have the tools and DRIVER philosophy to help me."*

*"I learned that growth comes from asking better questions, staying curious, and being willing to work through uncertainty."*

**The Partnership Model:**
*"I will carry forward the understanding that AI is a powerful engine, but I must remain the pilot."*

*"AI is not just a question-and-answer tool; it allows me to easily learn about areas I've never explored before."*

*"I'm leaving this class not just knowing finance but knowing how to think through problems with technology as a co-pilot."*

## The Arc That Matters

Looking across all three surveys, here's the transformation pattern:

**Week 4:** *"I'm confused. This isn't what I expected. I don't understand what we're doing."*

**Week 8:** *"I'm starting to get it. AI is a learning partner, not just an answer machine. The prompts matter."*

**Week 16:** *"I've changed. I think differently now. I'm not afraid of uncertainty. I know how to learn with AI, not just from AI."*

This arc—from confusion through struggle to transformation—isn't accidental. It's the mechanism.

Students who pushed through the early discomfort, who engaged with the productive struggle, who kept iterating even when frustrated—they emerged with something more valuable than financial formulas.

They learned to DRIVE.

## The Insight That Changed My Teaching

One student wrote something that crystallized what I've been trying to articulate for years:

*"The course showed me that we are at a crossroads where we either learn to use these tools or we get left behind. But the most important lesson wasn't just about speed. It was about vigilance. I realized that while AI is powerful, it requires a human 'driver' to catch the mistakes, logical errors, and calculation faults that the model inevitably makes."*

That's it. That's the whole philosophy in two sentences.

AI is powerful. But it requires a driver.

This course doesn't teach students to use AI. It teaches them to be the driver—to maintain control, exercise judgment, verify outputs, and develop the wisdom that AI cannot provide.

In an age where intelligence is infinite and free, only wisdom commands a premium.

These students are building that wisdom.
