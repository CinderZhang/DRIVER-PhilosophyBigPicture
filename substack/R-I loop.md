# **The R-I Loop: The Engine of Discovery**

*In the classroom, the problem is given. In the real world, it must be discovered.*

I gave you the problems in this course.

Every assignment came with a clear problem statement. "Build a DCF model." "Calculate portfolio risk." "Analyze this company."

You practiced the **DRIVER™** mechanics. But **D** (Discover & Define) was already decided for you.

In the real world, nobody hands you clean problem statements. They give you something vague:

* "Figure out if we should enter this market."  
* "Our customers are complaining."  
* "Make this process better."

You have to discover what you're actually solving.

Here is how that discovery happens.

## **The R-I Loop: How Understanding Emerges**

Classroom D (Given) → R → I → V → E → R (Straight line).  
Real World ? → \[ R ⇄ I \] (Spinning loop) → D (Emerges)  
You can't define what you don't understand yet. So, you have to start differently.

### **Step 1: Represent roughly (The Sketch)**

You don't know what the problem is yet, so you sketch what you *think* might be going on. A rough timeline. A basic flowchart. A list of drivers.

It's going to be wrong. Sketch it anyway. Get your thinking out of your head and onto paper.

### **Step 2: Implement small**

Pick the smallest piece you can test. You are not building the solution yet—you are testing if your representation makes sense.

* Can you get the data you sketched?  
* Does that relationship you drew actually exist?  
* Can you calculate what you said matters?

Don't build the full model. Test one assumption.

Right side (Green Check): "Plot One Dot".\]

### **Step 3: Reality fights back**

The data doesn't exist. The relationship is backwards. What you thought mattered is irrelevant.

This isn't failure. **This is information.**

### **Step 4: Represent better**

Go back to your sketch. Adjust it based on what you just learned. Redraw the relationships. Add the complexity you didn't see before.

### **Step 5: Implement another small piece**

Test another assumption. Discover another misunderstanding.

**R → I → R → I → R → I...**

After 3-5 cycles, something shifts. What felt fuzzy becomes clear. The *aha* moment strikes—you suddenly understand what you're actually solving.

That is when **D** crystallizes.

Not from thinking harder. From doing and learning.

## **Why Small Implementation Matters**

The key is understanding what "implement" means in this phase.

You're not building the solution. You're building the smallest thing that tests your current understanding.

* **Instead of:** Building the complete financial model  
  * **Test this:** Pull 10 rows of data. Can you access the fields you need?  
* **Instead of:** Writing all the analysis code  
  * **Test this:** Calculate one metric for one company. Does the formula work?  
* **Instead of:** Creating the full dashboard  
  * **Test this:** Plot one relationship. Does the pattern you expect appear?

Each small implementation asks reality: *"Is my mental model correct?"*

When reality says no, you get information. Information that makes your next representation better.

**知行合一 (Unity of Knowledge and Action)**—you don't know if your representation is right until you try to act on it.

## **Example: What This Actually Looks Like**

Your manager says: *"Analyze why our sales are down."*

Most people jump straight to building: Pull all sales data. Make charts. Calculate trends. Present findings.

**But using the R-I loop:**

**R1 (Represent):** Sketch what might affect sales—pricing, competition, seasonality, sales team performance.

**I1 (Implement):** Pull just Q4 data for the top 3 products. See if you can even access the sales data properly.

*Discovery:* Sales data exists but doesn't have product categories. Your initial representation missed this.

**R2 (Represent):** Redraw—sales data structure is flatter than you thought. Need to join with the product database.

**I2 (Implement):** Test the join on 50 records. See if the relationship works.

*Discovery:* The join works, but it reveals that 30% of sales have *no* product category. **This is the real issue.**

**R3 (Represent):** Represent the data quality problem you just found.

**I3 (Implement):** Calculate impact—uncategorized sales increased 300% in Q4.

**D (Define) crystallizes:** The problem isn't "why sales are down." It's *"why the sales team stopped categorizing products, and what revenue are we missing because of it?"*

You couldn't see this from the original question. You discovered it through R-I cycles.

## **What You Need to Practice**

You haven't really practiced this because I gave you the problems. That's fine—you needed to learn the mechanics first.

**But now you need to practice discovery.**

Before you graduate, find one undefined problem and solve it. Something where nobody tells you what "solving it" means.

When you do:

1. **Start rough.** Don't wait for clarity. Sketch what you think is happening, knowing you're wrong.  
2. **Test small.** Build the minimum thing that tests one assumption. Not the full solution—one piece.  
3. **Expect to revise.** Your first 2-3 representations will be wrong. That's the process, not a failure.  
4. **Iterate fast.** Rough sketch \+ quick test \+ revision \> perfect representation built on wrong assumptions.

Capture **D** when it emerges. After several cycles, you'll suddenly understand the real problem. **水到渠成** (When conditions are right, success follows naturally). Write it down immediately.

## **The Core Principle**

**Define doesn't come first. Define emerges from doing.**

When problems are unclear:

* You can't think your way to clarity.  
* You can't define before you understand.  
* You can only represent → test → learn → represent better.

The **R-I loop** is how you discover what you're actually solving.
