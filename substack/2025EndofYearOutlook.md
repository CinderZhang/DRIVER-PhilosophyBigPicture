# The World You're Walking Into

*A letter to my students as you step into your careers*

---

As you finish this course and prepare for what comes next, I want to have an honest conversation about the world you're entering. Not the career fair version. Not the fear-mongering version. The real one.

## The Shift That's Already Happening

The numbers tell a story that's worth understanding clearly.

In 2024, U.S. private AI investment hit $109.1 billion—nearly 12 times China's $9.3 billion and 24 times the U.K.'s $4.5 billion ([Stanford HAI 2025 AI Index Report](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report)). Private investment in generative AI reached $33.9 billion globally, up 18.7% from 2023.

But 2025 is where things accelerated dramatically.

Worldwide generative AI spending is expected to total **$644 billion in 2025**—a 76.4% increase from 2024 ([Gartner, March 2025](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-31-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-genai-spending-to-reach-644-billion-in-2025)). Major technology companies are investing a record **$320 billion in AI and data centers in 2025**, representing a 140% increase from 2024 spending levels ([All About AI](https://www.allaboutai.com/resources/ai-statistics/)).

ChatGPT alone doubled from 400 million users in February 2025 to 800 million users by September 2025—in just six months. OpenAI hit $10 billion in annualized recurring revenue by June 2025 ([Fullview AI Statistics](https://www.fullview.io/blog/ai-statistics)).

This isn't gradual change. This is a phase transition.

The proportion of organizations reporting AI use jumped to 78% in 2024, up from 55% in 2023 ([Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report)). But here's what matters more: McKinsey's 2025 State of AI survey (conducted June-July 2025) found that only **6% qualify as "AI high performers"** generating 5%+ EBIT impact ([McKinsey, November 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)). Widespread experimentation, but limited truly successful outcomes.

The gap between AI experimenters and AI orchestrators is already visible in the data. And it's widening.

## What's Actually Changing in Your Future Roles

Let me be specific about the fields many of you are entering.

### Investment Banking

The transformation is no longer theoretical.

**JPMorgan Chase** now has 250,000 employees with access to their AI platform—the entire workforce except branch and call center staff. Half of them use it roughly every day ([CNBC, September 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/jpmorgan-chase-fully-ai-connected-megabank.html)).

**Bank of America** CEO Brian Moynihan announced at their November 2025 investor day: "All 213,000 people are getting access to AI as we speak" ([Fortune, November 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/11/07/bank-of-america-ceo-ai-deployed-across-entire-workforce-to-drive-growth-productivity/)). Their software developers using GenAI-based coding tools have experienced efficiency gains of over 20% ([Fortune, November 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/11/05/bank-of-america-prioritizes-bigger-ai-initiatives-as-annual-spending-on-new-tech-increased-by-44-over-the-past-decade/)).

Deloitte predicts that the top 14 global investment banks can boost front-office productivity by 27%–35% using generative AI, resulting in additional revenue of $3.5 million per front-office employee by 2026 ([Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/generative-ai-in-investment-banking.html)).

But here's what should get your attention:

**OpenAI's "Mercury" Project**: In October 2025, OpenAI enlisted more than 100 ex-investment bankers—from JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs—to train AI models specifically on building financial models that could automate hours of entry-level tasks ([Fortune, October 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/10/22/sam-altman-openai-wall-street-junior-bankers-ai-entry-level-jobs/)).

They're not building AI to assist junior bankers. They're building AI to do what junior bankers do.

The workforce implications are already materializing. Citigroup estimates that **54% of banking roles are at risk of displacement** due to AI, with another 12% likely to be augmented ([AInvest, September 2025](https://www.ainvest.com/news/ai-driven-workforce-transformation-banking-investment-implications-balancing-automation-labor-costs-2509/)). Some banks have reduced junior hiring by 66%. One AI-empowered analyst can now do the work of five ([Finalis](https://www.finalis.com/blog/how-ai-is-reshaping-investment-banking-workforce)).

Morgan Stanley's analysis suggests that full AI adoption across S&P 500 companies could add $920 billion in annual net benefits, with 90% of occupations affected to some degree ([Morgan Stanley, 2H 2025](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-workplace-outlook-2H-2025)).

### The Training Gap Problem

Here's the uncomfortable reality nobody talks about at recruiting events.

Junior analysts historically learned investment banking through repetitive manual work. Spreading comps. Formatting pitch books. Building models cell by cell. That grunt work wasn't just labor—it was education. You developed intuition by doing the same thing hundreds of times.

If AI handles that work, how do junior analysts develop judgment?

JPMorgan's head of AI, Hari Waldron, described workers shifting from being "makers" of reports or software updates to "checkers" or managers of AI agents doing that work ([CNBC, September 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/jpmorgan-chase-fully-ai-connected-megabank.html)).

The implication: You need to arrive Day 1 with sophistication that used to take two years to acquire. The apprenticeship model that built generations of bankers is being compressed—or eliminated entirely.

## The Paradox You Need to Understand

Here's what Gartner observed: "Expectations for GenAI's capabilities are declining due to high failure rates in initial proof-of-concept work and dissatisfaction with current GenAI results" ([Gartner, March 2025](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-31-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-genai-spending-to-reach-644-billion-in-2025)).

And yet spending increased 76% anyway.

This paradox tells you something important. Organizations aren't investing because AI works perfectly. They're investing because they believe it will work eventually, and they can't afford to be left behind.

McKinsey found that AI high performers are more than three times more likely than others to say their organization intends to use AI to bring about transformative change ([McKinsey, November 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)). The gap between leaders and laggards isn't closing—it's accelerating.

You're entering the workforce at the bottom of the productivity J-curve. Everything is messy. The rules are being written in real-time. The organizations that figure out AI collaboration in the next 3-5 years will define the standards everyone else follows.

This is your opportunity. You've practiced systematic AI collaboration while most of your peers were still being told AI is either a threat to avoid or a magic tool that requires no skill to use.

## The Two Paths Forward

Every professional using AI falls into one of two categories. The distinction isn't subtle.

**The AI-Dependent Professional:**
- Prompts, accepts, submits
- Can't tell when AI is wrong (because they lack domain depth to evaluate)
- Doesn't know what questions to ask
- Produces high volume, looks productive
- Fragile—when AI fails, they fail with it
- Competes on speed with machines (and loses)

**The AI Orchestrator:**
- Understands the problem before engaging AI
- Sees structure in messy situations
- Tests outputs against reality
- Maintains productive doubt
- Evolves methods continuously
- Builds compounding knowledge over time
- Becomes the "human in the loop" that organizations desperately need

DRIVER trained you to be the second type.

When Citigroup says 54% of banking roles are at risk of displacement, they're talking about the first type. When banks cut junior hiring by 66%, they're cutting the positions that require only the first type.

The AI orchestrator role isn't being eliminated. It's becoming more valuable.

## What I Actually Hope For You

When you're staring at an AI-generated analysis that looks perfect but feels slightly wrong—trust that feeling. Interrogate it. That instinct is precisely what makes you valuable.

Your job isn't to accept AI output. Your job is to ask the questions AI doesn't know to ask.

AI doesn't know what it doesn't know. It doesn't feel the subtle wrongness of a calculation that's technically correct but practically meaningless. It doesn't ask "are we solving the right problem?" before generating an elegant solution to the wrong one.

You do. Or at least, you can.

The questions aren't obstacles to productivity. They're your entire source of value in an AI-saturated workplace.

---

## The Long View

I can't predict your exact career path. The specific skills that matter will transform by 2030. The tools you're using today will be replaced by tools that don't exist yet.

But the six disciplines of awareness don't expire:

- Identifying real problems vs. impressive-sounding fake ones
- Seeing structure in chaos
- Testing your beliefs against reality
- Maintaining productive self-doubt
- Staying curious about what doesn't exist yet
- Turning experience into knowledge that transfers

These aren't skills you learned for a course. They're capabilities that compound over a career.

---

Some of you will forget most of what we covered within six months. That's fine. The letters are here when you need them.

Some of you will carry these disciplines forward and become the professionals that others turn to when the stakes are high. I can't force that. I can only create the conditions and hope.

You're more prepared than you realize. Now go build something worth building.
