## The Opportunity

Purdue is preparing a major proposal for the Lilly Endowment's AI in Higher Education initiative (up to $25M implementation grant). **DSB has a proven, ready-to-scale contribution: the DRIVER methodology.**

## What DRIVER Gives DSB

**A Concrete Answer to Lilly's Core Question:**  
*"How will your institution manage AI's impact on curriculum, pedagogy, and assessments?"*

**DRIVER provides:**

- Assessment innovation (video presentations) that solves AI cheating while embracing AI as tool
- "Foundation before amplification" pedagogy that prevents AI-dependent learning
- Ready to scale across DSB and Purdue

**Current Evidence:**
- 300+ students using it (Financial Data Analytics I&II, Financial Modeling, Financial Management)
- Developed with and tested with 81% positive student feedback *(Financial Data Analytics I&II, Financial Modeling)*

## Why This Matters for DSB

**1. Lead the AI Transformation**

**4. Build External Visibility**
