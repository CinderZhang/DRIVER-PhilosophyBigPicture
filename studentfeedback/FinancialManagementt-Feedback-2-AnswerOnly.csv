"My mindset has definitely changed quite a lot since the start of the semester. I knew how capable AI was in industries such as financial management, but I didn't have the knowledge how to contextualize AI tools and use them to my advantage. However, after learning the DRIVER framework and other AI/financial principles, I've learned how to set up AI prompts and give it the information in a way that it can most accurately complete the given task. I know how to prompt it efficiently and work around issues that I would not know how to tackle otherwise. For example, having the opportunity to use AI to automate monthly loan payments and the split between principal/interest is something I really enjoyed. I am pursuing a Real Estate minor at Purdue, so seeing how I can use AI to further my understanding of RE principles with AI was an invaluable experience for me. I also really enjoyed using AI for stock and bond analysis. I actively trade and invest without AI to help me. Now, however, I can utilize AI to help me make better investment decisions and grow my portfolio effectively."
"This semester, learning financial management through AI tools has completely reshaped how I view both finance and technology. Initially, I saw AI as something distant, mainly useful for automating tasks. Still, through hands-on use of the OpenAI API, Gemini, n8n, and Python, I realized that AI can be an interactive learning partner that deepens understanding rather than replacing it.
For example, while building an AI-driven finance tool in n8n, I used the OpenAI API to summarize spending patterns and classify transactions into ""needs automatically,"" ""wants,"" and ""savings."" This process forced me to think critically about prompt design, data accuracy, and ethical use of financial information. Similarly, using Python for portfolio optimization and risk analysis helped me connect financial theories, like expected return and variance, to real data through coding and visualization.
Working with Gemini also showed me the value of cross-checking AI outputs. Comparing its responses with OpenAI's taught me that AI models have strengths and biases, and effective use requires human oversight and financial reasoning.Overall, my mindset about AI has shifted from skepticism to partnership. I've learned that when used responsibly, AI can transform learning by automating routine calculations, visualizing complex relationships, and providing personalized feedback, allowing me to focus on deeper strategic and ethical thinking in financial decision-making."
"This semester, I learned how to use AI tools to help me understand financial management. At first, I thought AI was just something to give quick answers. But as I used it more, I saw that it could actually help me learn and think better. For example, when I worked on money problems like budgeting or investments, AI helped me test different ideas and see how changes affected the results. I also used it in group projects to compare financial plans. I learned that AI works best when I ask good questions and still use my own judgment. Now I see AI as a helpful learning partner, not just a shortcut to answers."
"This class emphasizes both the importance of utilizing AI with a designated framework and its endless possibilities. Although I have always been optimistic towards AI, I'm being able to use this technology to learn more efficiently and hence become more organized overall with my schoolwork, while retaining the information learned. A specific example that exemplifies  effectively using AI as a learning partner was when I had to produce mini-project 1. I had to create a compound interest visualizer and through the DRIVER framework and looping, I was able to implement a more complex project introducing regular contributions and accounting for inflation. Essentially, evolving it, one step at a time, into a sophisticated tool that models real-world financial planning. Now I am able to explain concepts from that project with ease."
"I think my mindset on AI has stayed the same for this course and I think it semi hinders our ability to understand the content. However, there are times when it is beneficial in being able to show us examples and other more developed logics that relates to the content."
I think I am putting a lot of effort to follow the directions and take a long time analyzing the homework but sometimes it seems as there is things that are not being asked that are expected to be in our answers. I think I have found the correct way to fulfill these tasks being asked of me after numerous questions and communicaitons though. I just hope the same expectations that I have been fulfilling continue to be the standard that is being asked. As for that I feel like we are learning many useful tools and different ways to utilize them. I hope to continue to find the best way to work all the apps and tools that you through at me.
"Learning financial management with AI tools is really helping me understand how AI can be helpful for the modern world. The DRIVER method has also helped me to better approach my problems and tasks, and I will surely use the DRIVER method in the future for my projects and assignments because I feel it is a very useful technique."
"This course has enabled me to utilize AI in finances in a way that I didn't think I could. I knew how to use AI for simple tasks but this course has helped me refine my AI prompting skills in order to obtain deeper, and more insightful responses from AI models. I have learned that in order for an AI model to get useful and exact responses, you must be very specific and clear about your instructions and that it is only as useful as you know how to use it."
I think it has been great overall. I absolutely love that there is enough flexibility with the coursework and also the fact I get to actively integrate AI into this helps with the guilt of using it( happens with other courses.)
"My mindset about AI has stayed mostly the same throughout this semester. I have always seen it as a tool that can help improve my work, but I did not realize how powerful it truly is. Through this course, I discovered how much AI can support my learning and boost creativity. One of my biggest surprises came from using Base44 to create my Mini Project 1 financial tool, which showed me how capable AI is in developing practical applications. In Mini Project 2, I created a Rent vs. Buy calculator using n8n, something I never thought I could make so easily with AI. I have learned that AI works best when I use it as a partner, giving my own instructions and applying my own judgment to the results. This class has shown me that AI can greatly enhance how I learn and create when used thoughtfully."
I have learned how to utilize the AI in new ways that I would have never thought of before especially bringing it into the financial workspace. AI is able to create graphics and explain how to do the problem while also  showing the entire process. It more easily allows us to present accurate and clear information in a effective way.
My mindset about AI has changed a little bit since the start of this class. I do have a better understanding of how to use chat gpt or google Gemini to aid my thinking instead of just prompting it for answers. I also have learned that it is not wise to rely on AI for correct answers all the time because it is a tool not an answer machine. Using DRIVE has helped me guide AI to help me solve tough problems. But I still think that this class was a little misguiding for is actually necessary information for us.
"My Mindset on using AI has definitely changed as now I am more comfortable prompting my AI and using it as a tool. Even for other classes, it has become a helpful resource for me to learn with and I appreciate the way it helps me understand different topics. AI is definitely an effective learning partner, it can help me with practice problems and I have been using it to prompt me with different scenarios that I can use to practice with. For example, in the last session assignment I did not understand the numbers because it was confusing so I was able to prompt my AI with that issue and it provided me different graphics and charts that helped me see the data visually, ultimately helping me understnad it better."
"My mindset about AI has changed slightly. I used to think that AI could only be used as a chatbot. However, that has evolved into understanding that AI can be used for so much more and can even automate tasks. I have also learned how to use it as a learning partner by using it to explain complex concepts and helping me do calculations. Specifically, in the stock valuation I used it to explain the concepts and help do the analysis of the stocks."
"I have learned that AI is a very good tool for learning. By prompting it correctly, it can help you learn new things you never thought you could know. A specific example is every session assignment. BY me prompting it right telling it exactly what I want it to do, has allowed me to get the prompts completely correct."
"So far, I have realized that AI is very unpredictable, and it takes multiple iterations and experiments to get the final product you are looking for. At the start, I was getting good scores on my sessions, but then I got too comfortable with the AI output and had to adjust how I completed the assignments. My learning partner has taught me how to use the loop method on AI output and how to ensure the code is correct, for example, on the last session  he helped me learn how to check and confirm the expected return formula."
"I have really enjoyd my experience learning financial management with AI tools this semester. My mindset has continued to grow with every assignment and project that I do; the things I have learned that AI can do in terms of financial management are truly remarkable. It will teach you any concept that you dont know in a completely custom way and in the matter of seconds. Ive also learned that AI can be wrong sometimes computing the numbers, however it is good for structuring financial models or builiding tools like those we make in the mini projects."
"Learning with AI tools sometimes can make the learning process more complicated. I think this because for 2 reasons. 1) It is great to get better explanations and much longer debriefs for when to use this formula or what exactly it computes. 2) If AI can be unreliable when it comes to math then why are we only putting equations through it that could potentially be wrong. I am sometimes confused as to why we are being reliant on AI when we are told to think for ourselves. However, I have learned many ways to use AI to my advantage. I now know the proper way to get a good answer from it."
"Throughout the semester I have grown significantly in my AI knowledge and usage. Throughout the course I have been able to use AI for things I never thought I would be able to personally do. The first thing that comes to mind is project 2 that I just finished up. I never would have believed that I would come out of a finance class understanding how to create tools that code and do simple for calculations for me. I always believed that to be way to complicated for me to do personally. However, with AI I am able to produce something of substance that helps."
"I'd like to think this class has taught me how to use AI more effectively and efficiently, through the DRIVER way of thinking.


 For example, using AI for programming financial calculators throughout this class (something that I could not do without AI and/or tens, if not hundreds, of hours of programming knowledge).

 Another example is comparing prompts and their vastly different (or not) outcomes between learning partners in class, which really helps master the ability to write a well-written prompt that the AI can understand and delve deeper into.
The use of AI can also make learning tedious things more enjoyable"
"I do think AI makes a lot more errors than I originally thought before this class. I struggled a lot with Mini Project 2 because of how inconsistent it was with AI outputs. I learned how to use AI effectively by just simply asking it questions and when it doesn't provide the output that I had hoped for, I just tweak the prompt until it does. One example is, again, the Mini Project 2. During this project, I could not figure out what to paste into n8n to get the responses to finally say todays date. After a lot of changed prompts and about 100 trial and errors, I was finally able to figure it out."
The thing that changed my mind most about AI was the mini project 2 that I completed this week. It really opened my eyes to how easy it can be to make something so useful with AI.
"I feel much more confident in using AI. At school, we were taught to be ""ashamed"" of AI. Now, we are taught to use it properly. For example, for the Mini-Project 2, I used ChatGPT to give me the prompt to tell my ChatBot instead of me writing it. Even though I could write my own prompt, it is way simpler to do that and it allows me to focus in other tasks that can not be automated and actually need a human touch."
"AI has been significantly helpful with this course, it has been a helpful tool to navigate through assignments and questions. It is a great guidance and also a great idea generator. I like how AI is incorporated within this class. However, AI is not 100% the correct answer it still need human to guide and fix the mistakes. It can also be exhausting when training an AI but it is much better to work through homework with AI rather than without."
"I think AI really helped me self learn a lot of the This semester, I learned a lot using AI as part of my Financial Management course. I had so many questions throughout the class, and AI really helped me figure things out and improve my weekly assignments. At first, I used AI mostly to get quick answers, but over time, I started to see it more as a tool that actually teaches me.


For example, in Mini Project 2, I was super confused about how to connect my code to the agent. I asked AI how to do it, and it gave me ideas and step-by-step instructions. That helped me understand how n8n works instead of just copying the solution. After that, I felt like I really understood what I was doing and could use the website better.
Overall, my mindset about AI has definitely changed. Now, I use it to guide my learning instead of just getting answers. It's helped me become more confident, and I feel like I can learn new things faster when I use AI the right way."
"Being in this class has helped me understand just how powerful of a tool AI really is and can be. I never really used AI before this class. I didn't really know that it was capable of doing so much. To use AI effectively as a tool and aiding in learning, I have learned that your prompts have to be very specific to get what you want out of it. You really have to narrow down what you want out of it because it is capable of so much. I find that it is helpful to tell AI to act as a tutor and that I want to solve a problem using DRIVER. Some of the assignments like the real estate one can have so many moving parts to making a decision and so it was especially important to explain your workflow process. All in all, I have enjoyed getting to learn more about using AI and how to use it to my advantage."
"My mindset has shifted a bit, it's become easier for me to navigate AI, though I'm still not very tech-savvy. Because of that, creating an app feels difficult, and I don't fully see the purpose behind it. I understand that it's meant to be a helpful tool, but I'm not sure it's something we really need to do. AI tools like Gemini, however, have been extremely useful for discussions, brainstorming ideas, and exploring different directions. They've helped me analyze the DRIVER method the most, and Gemini has been valuable in every session. In particular, it helped me develop my scenarios in sessions 3, 4, 5, and 6 by guiding how I should allocate and divide my money. For example, in session 6, I compared several ratios between Tesla stock and various bonds to build a portfolio stronger than the S&P 500. It was also helpful in session 3 when deciding how to invest my $75,000 across stocks, bonds, and savings. Gemini's explanations helped me understand the reasoning behind those ratios and made the numbers and percentages in my calculations much clearer."
"I am struggling to really be able to learn with AI, I feel like it is a great way to learn more and be able to accomplish things that have never been thought of, but I am struggling to find out how to do that. I am more interested in how prompts affect outputs more though and I am eager to learn how to utilize this tool. I want to be able to know how the calculations work and I am trying to figure it out with my AI learning partner. This is a huge learning curve that I am ready to tackle head on. For example, I want to be able to understand the code and the calculations of what Gemini makes for co lab. I hope to learn how to use AI better than I have been prior, I just need a little help."
"Overall throughout this course I feel like I have learned and grown a lot by working with Ai. Before this course I would just use Ai to give me answers to homework or things I was too lazy to do. But now I am actually using Ai to help enhance my learning and my knowledge. I have been getting a lot better with prompting Ai throughout this course to grow my capabilities. For example on our assignments I have to use python code, so I have been getting a lot better with prompting the Ai to output me a python code that is very effective and enhances my work for my assignment. I am really curious to keep learning about Ai because it can do some very powerful things, and I want to be very useful with Ai so that I can be effective in the workforce."
"My mindset about AI has almost stayed the same. I say this because I have learned that it can be a fantastic learning and calculation tool for rapid results, but the interpretation and analysis MUST be done by myself. This here is what I've learned about AI over this semester in this course. By leveraging the data provided rapidly from AI, we are able to provide financial results and ""advice"" to our ""clients"". I mean this in a sense of real-world applications because AI can be a friend, but it can also be an enemy if you do not know the data it is providing. 


For finance, AI can provide data that needs to be interpreted based on different applications and models (real estate, bonds, CD's, etc.) and this is where I have learned to appreciate this class. Even if we don't grow as financiers, we should be able to determine the best course of action for a potential investment in the future.
Thank you Professor Z"
"I'd say my mindset on AI has changed in a way in a way that it's been opened to how many possibilities it actually contains. Attempting to use n8n cloud was a interesting experience to say the least but was really fun as I got to connect it to things like Slack and see how AI can be used ourselves rather than plainly depending on Gemini. Moreover, being able to combine what I know and AI's capabilities has been really interesting as I've been able to create things like code which I never would've been able to do before. Previously, I was very AI and AI tool averse in the past, but I've definitely grown to see its capabilities but also, its downfalls and how dependency on it and trusting it blindly can lead to dangerous outcomes. 9 Times out of 10 it's perfect but the remaining time, it will lie to me or tell me something wrong or read something incorrectly such as working with data when I was feeding it information during a session assignment and it is misreading and putting the wrong number down. Overall, my opinion of Ai has grown, and I feel my understanding of it has done just the same."
"This class has greatly helped me learn to use AI in a productive way. I did not fully understand the capabilities of AI tools such as gemini in the past, however this class has shown me their usefulness, especially in the finance world. My mindset has become far more optimistic as I have seen how humans can use AI to benefit them instead of replace them. The most important skill I have learned in this class has been learning how to construct prompts to be able to write code efficiently."
"My mindset about AI has completely changed over the course of this semester. Earlier I used to see AI as the future that would completely take over the job market, now I see it as a tool and it is not a crutch that should completely over take human think rather it is a tool that can help humans if used and maximized correctly. Using AI effectively is going to be a key tool in the future as every field of study is going to implement it some way or another and it should be used as a learning partner since we should not be completely be dependent on it. During the course of this class I have used AI as a learning partner by only making the AI doing majority of the coding while I would make sense of what it has coded and how it can be used to solve the problem at hand."
My perspective on AI has changed since taking this class. My current understanding of AI is that it is used as a tool to help guide and learn. Using the DRIVER framework that we have been practicing each week really helps line up the different concepts of finance we are learning. I can successfully use AI as a learning partner by giving detailed prompts to AI to learn what I need to learn for the concepts in finance.
I Really like the AI integration in the class. I think we live in a world of AI and AI is the future. Learning how to properly use AI while doing the financial analysis helps me build myself and get ready for the future.
"This semester, using AI tools like Gemini for financial management has actually changed the way I learn. At first, I thought AI was just something to get quick answers from, but I started realizing it can really help you understand the ""why"" behind the numbers. For example, when I was working on things like the CAPM and dividend discount model, Gemini helped me break down what each part of the formula meant instead of just solving it. That made it easier for me to connect everything we learned in class to real situations.


I also used it when I got stuck on topics like portfolio risk and return. It helped me understand how risk affects returns and how to think through my decisions rather than just memorizing terms. Over time, I learned that AI works best when you actually interact with it—ask follow-up questions, double-check what it says, and use it to support your own reasoning.
Overall, this experience made me more open to using AI as a learning tool. It's not a replacement for learning the material myself, but it's been a great way to get feedback, understand concepts faster, and practice applying them to real examples."
"I think my mindset have really changed about AI. I think I especially loved learning about the AI agent because I never thought I could create something like that, it really made me feel empowered. I think I have been able to learn so much so quickly but using AI as a learning partner and have deep understanding of finance concepts such as present value and future value."
"This semester changed how I think about AI in finance. I used to see AI as a way to cheat with quick answers, but building my loan affordability workflow showed me AI can actually help me learn concepts too. When I gave more specific prompts, like asking how the monthly payment was calculated or what a debt-to-income ratio means, AI explained it clearly after a few attempts and helped me learn the actual reasoning behind the numbers. Now I see AI as a useful learning partner, not something that replaces the work, but something that makes financial decisions easier to understand."
"Classes are going better than before, content is clarified and understandable. Still enjoy peer learning and completing our video assignments."
"I believe that the DRIVER framework has been a very useful way to approach problems and learn about finances, especially with assistance from AI like Google Gemini. I have come to learn that when you give it the right prompt, AI is very useful and can be a great tool to help become more familiar with terminology as well as figure out how to solve problems inside and outside of school. I still believe many people don't know how to effectively use AI to learn and instead use it to cheat or get shortcuts for assignments, but this class has definitely taught me how to use AI better than I previously have. However, I still don't feel like using AI to learn the concepts in the way that we have has allowed me to learn and feel knowledgeable about these new concepts as I would in the more orthodox way and I feel like I would've learned the concepts better when taking notes from a normal lecture, but I definitely feel like I've benefitted from the assignments in the terms of AI usage and confidence using sites like Replit and n8n to build things. An example of learning through AI usage that I've experienced in this class was learning how to create a better prompt. I think the emails from the professor about things we can improve upon from each assignment has definitely helped me to develop skills with searching things in Gemini and finding effective answers, so that is my biggest takeaway from the class and my learning. I do feel like the instructions for assignments and in class demos could be clearer in the way that they are described, as I feel like when doing assignments, the instruction from the professor can be a bit vague. Also, I think grading can be unfair at times since some people put a lot of work into these assignments just to get an insufficient grade, so it can seem a little unfair at times. But I feel like this class has been more beneficial to me than not so that is good. I look forward to seeing how the rest of the semester goes."
"Honestly, it has only strengthened my opinion on AI. It is key to be the one driving AI, not to become entirely dependent on it. You must be able to differentiate your strengths from those of AI, as if your key strengths are replaceable by AI, you will become obsolete. Using AI to drive my financial analysis has been extremely helpful so far, and I have been able to produce key data to inform my decisions on investments, loan calculations, and related matters. Being able to use AI to help commandeer my Python code has also been extremely helpful in coding functions and complex compounding equations. My favorite example was our session assignment in which we were given a hypothetical portfolio and return rates, and found the optimal split between more aggressive stocks (Tesla) and more conservative ones (S&P) and bonds."
"I feel like my mindset about AI has evolved a lot. I feel that I was barely reaching its potential. Because I used it for questions or help studying, but in this class I've learned that it can do so much more, and I've appreaciate to have learned what more it can do. I also learned that it is highly effective as a learining, it responds any doubt I ever have and explains to me the problems I may have trying to understand something. My examples would be the mini-projects like creating an AI and the python codes he can formulate by just naming a problem."
"My experience in learning financial management with AI tools this semester has been nothing short of great. My mindset on AI has changed drastically because i now see it as a tool for finance not a tool to find answers. I have learned that i can use AI to help me code and make strategic financial decisions about stocks and bonds and how to diversify my portfolios for risk management. In this course, I am most excited for the stocks and portfolio management. Like right now, we are learning how to mitigate risks by diversifying portfolios and how to create good purchases."
"So far, my experience with learning financial management using AI has been challenging yet useful. So far, learning financial management with the integration of AI has been both challenging and rewarding. The first mini-project was particularly difficult due to some technical issues, but the second project was engaging and introduced me to entirely new concepts and tools. Despite the challenges, I've gained more practical knowledge than I would have in a traditional financial management class without the AI component.


My mindset in the beginning was open-minded but nervous for the new learning curves to come, and that has been consistent so far, but I am feeling more confident in using some of these applications now that I never knew existed.
AI is a useful tool, but it is just that- a tool. It can only be as good as the person using it. That is why it is important to do what we are doing each day: learning how to DRIVE(R) AI so that it delivers results that we want and accurate results."
"Personally, I have not found the AI to be much help in my learning of the course; in fact, I feel that it has hindered it. Obviously, AI is important and will impact all of our lives moving forward, but this takes away from actually learning the material. Luckily, I am an actuarial science major, so I come into the course with lots of prior knowledge on the subject, but my class partner, who doesn't have that background, is struggling. AI has replaced the learning, and no other MGMT 310 course focuses this heavily on AI. I haven't found the assignments to be particularly helpful for improving my knowledge. The whole point of the course is to get a background on finance, but because everyone uses AI, there is no point in learning the material. I feel the assignments should be structured differently to not include as much reliance on AI. I understand AI is not supposed to replace learning, but unfortunately, that's what a lot of people do, so instead of encouraging that, changes should be made to teach the material without such a heavy reliance on AI."
"I understand that we are trying to learn how to use AI with these financial concepts but lately I've been feeling that I don't fully understand the financial concepts or that I thought I understood things but maybe I didn't and I've been using AI as a crutch. I think this class is trying to do a good thing by involving AI but in my opinion we should also be practicing how to use the equations we've learned by hand because doing it by hand and without the aid of any technology ensures you fully understand the financial concepts. Then once you have proven you understand these financial concepts and equations by hand, AI should be integrated into the work."
"Coming into this semester, I did not expect to be using AI as a tool to learn financial management. However, even though I didn't expect it, I will say it has been a tool that's helped me learn financial management in new ways. For example, in the assignment ""Mini Project 1"", we were prompted to create an app that helped us solve real world financial scenarios such as calculating Earned Interest over time or Bond Investing tips. 

By using AI as a learning partner, I have to admit that it has improved my knowledge of financial management and certain real-life scenarios. Overall, AI can be used a versatile learning tool that helps students apply what's demonstrated throughout in class assignments, to real world scenarios."
"By applying AI, I have transformed my approach to learning, making it more dynamic and efficient. For instance, I recently developed a practical tool to analyze bond investments (Session 4) and conducted a data-driven analysis of APR to model the financial implications of renting versus buying (Session 5). These applications sharpened my ability to turn complex data into actionable financial insights."
"My mindset toward AI in finance has completely changed this semester. I started hesitant, but now I'm fully open and feel knowledgeable about how to use AI as an effective learning partner. The key was learning to guide the AI, especially using the DRIVER framework, which taught me how to move beyond simple questions. This new approach allowed me to gain valuable, real-world insights in complex areas. For example:


I was able to deeply analyze stock versus bond decisions, modeling different scenarios instead of just getting a basic definition.

I used the AI to explore the rent versus buy dilemma with specific variables, helping me understand the long-term implications.
By learning to direct the AI, I've been able to use it as a true collaborator and feel much more prepared to make financial decisions in the future."
"For a while, and even at the beginning of this semester, I have viewed AI as a tool for getting answers fast. However, this class has taught me that AI is more than just that; it is also a great helper in guiding a thinking process. 

For example, working through problems such as break-even analysis, I used AI to walk me through the formulas, that way I gained a better understanding of the purpose of certain tools and gain a deeper understanding of how to solve for problems. On the contrary, I have found that this class is a little difficult for me to relate to the real world at times. For example, I tend to struggle on the interactive assignments, but using these tools has helped me to bridge that gap a little bit."
"I have always been hesitant to use AI as I thought it would take away from me using my skills to my fullest ability; however, after using AI in this class, my mindset has changed. I now see how AI is essentially only a tool to be used to make tasks more efficient. I have learnt how to leverage it to bring my unique ideas and skills into my work. After using AI as a learning partner for a while, I have learned how important a prompt can be, as it can be the difference maker in concrete and solid responses from the AI. An example of this would include the gradual improvement in my prompt writing for the homework assignments, as I realised that by not being clear and including more detail in the prompt it now only gives the AI less information to work with, but also doesn't allow me to test my understanding of the content."
"I have enjoyed learning how to use AI more. When used correctly I understand how it can be a tool instead of something that is putting my learning to a halt. It helps the concepts make a lot more sense because it fully explains them and is able to represent them. When I think about using AI now I feel confident that I can use it as a learning tool instead of a supplement to doing my homework assignments. I've learned how important it is to keep it simple. When you overcomplicate things or ask AI too much any once many parts could be missed that are very basic and not overly complicated.  For example, when doing my session assignments sometimes if I ask chat too much at one time, it will not properly complete the assignment. I will have to reiterate certain points of the assignment that are important."
"Throughout the course, I think I use a lot of Google Gemini AI to the coding(like Python), and it helps a lot with all the calculations. Before the class I already feel like AI is the great help for life in general, but as now I learned that AI can also do your coding like this, it just expend my horizon, and very much suprisied me."
"I realized how important it has become to understand how to use AI since all companies are implenting it in some ways. I realized this when we were looking at the Accenture article in class. I learned that it is good at providing analysis but it's calculations are not very accurate. Therefore, whenever I have to make any calculations I ask it to generate python code because that consistently provides correct answers."
"My mindset has stayed the same about using AI effectively as a learning partner. It is important to use it as a tool and helper, and not a replacement. It is also important to always validate and check and do the calculations on your own before implementing AI. I also have learned the importance of correct prompts and how being specific is extremely important when making sure that accurate data is given. For example, when using AI to help with Time Value of Money Calculations and Risk Portfolio decisions, it is extremely important to provide the exact, textbook formulas and analysis that you want AI to help with. This is to help with more relevant answers and not as broad, not specified answers that don't do much for an analysis."
"This semester, using AI tools in financial management demonstrated to me that AI can help break down complex topics, such as formulas and spreadsheets, into simple steps. My mindset has changed because I used to think AI just provided answers, but now I see that it works best when I guide it with clear instructions and double-check the results myself. Overall, I learned that AI is a helpful learning partner, not a shortcut, because it supports my understanding instead of replacing it."
"As we reach the halfway point in this class, I can honestly say it has been really beneficial in teaching me how to use AI more smartly. When I started, I didn't know much about coding or how AI tools actually worked behind the scenes. I thought AI was just something that gave quick answers. But after working through the projects and assignments, I've realized that it's more like a learning partner that helps you think through problems and explore new ideas.

I've really enjoyed how hands-on the class has been. Figuring things out on my own and experimenting has made everything click more. Mini-Project 2 really showed me this—it had the right mix of resources and freedom. I got to ""mess around"" with the tools, test what worked, and learn from trial and error. It was challenging at first, but that's what made it fun and rewarding once I figured it out.
Throughout this course, I've learned how to use AI not just for quick help, but as a tool to understand concepts better. For example, I've used it to check my reasoning in financial problems, get feedback on my writing, and understand why certain solutions work. My mindset about AI has definitely changed. I now see it as something that supports learning, encourages curiosity, and helps me develop new skills that I can use beyond this class."
"This semester, using AI for financial management shifted my mindset from seeing it as a simple answer-finder to viewing it as an interactive learning partner that can simulate complex problems, such as analyzing a company's financial health or modeling bond investments. I learned that AI is most effective when I use specific, iterative prompts, which helped me move beyond just definitions to actually applying financial ratios and valuation techniques in realistic scenarios."
"I do not mind using the AI tools to help us learn. I enjoy using AI and learning it in that way to then teach it because teaching is the best way to learn. I would only say that I wish it were not so copy and paste into AI. I would like it more if we were guided to insert prompts rather than given a full prompt and just copy and paste it into Google Gemini. I have learned a little bit about how to prompt Gemini. I started prompting in the driver method first, and then added the full prompt. I have learned that at times I have to ask for either more questions to be answered or to separate the responses into different ways. I have asked it to make me a presentation before, and that caused more follow-up questions. I would say overall, the assignments have helped me use AI in a better way, but as always, there is room for improvement."
"This semester, using AI in financial management has shown me its practical value, especially in implementing the driver framework. AI helped me break down complex financial drivers, model their interrelationships, and quickly test scenarios. By generating step-by-step calculations and explanations, it clarified how changes in key drivers affect outcomes like revenue, costs, and profitability. My mindset shifted from seeing AI as just a calculator to a learning partner that enhances understanding and speeds up analysis. It proved particularly useful in exploring ""what-if"" scenarios and validating assumptions within the driver framework efficiently."
"This semester, I was impressed by the power of AI. Mini project 2, building a financial tool with the n8n platform, created a solution to a real-world, immediate issue or problem. Originally, my assumption of the use of AI was that it lacked the stability to understand complex needs, but it's strength is guidance, which became very useful."
"My mindset about AI during this semester has changed because my abilities with AI have changed. After more than half a semester, I understand how to use the tools to a deeper learning, and how they can be a teacher, partner and even student. The course continues to challenge me with the video assignments as well as the project submissions, and I hope to continue learning and partnering with AI for time to come."
"My perspective on AI has primarily stayed the same. Before this class, I thought it was a good tool that could be used effectively, but was easily exploited for short-term benefit. As the class has gone on and I've used AI more, I still hold that belief; the only difference is that I think it is marginally harder to exploit because it requires specific instructions to reduce the chance of error. And this requires you, on some level, to understand the material. For example, in every assignment, if you give the instruction to an AI exactly and do no intermittent editing or clearer instructions, you are not going to get a product that actually meets the guidelines, or sometimes the result isn't even functional."
"When entering this course, and even since the last feedback I gave, I didn't realize the impact that AI can have on your learning. Obviously, you can abuse it and not learn anything. However, when you apply it to expanding your knowledge on a topic, giving you meaningful examples, or using it as a study tool, AI is very helpful. I have started to utilize it for other classes like I do this one. It allows you to see different perspectives that you wouldn't see in class or even in your textbook. As for the second part of the question, I think using AI with others can be even more impactful. You may get something similar to them, but they may have something hidden in their output that allows you to understand the topic better. Additionally, learning with a partner allows you to see their thinking process, which can be very beneficial to you as well."
"Throughout this semester, learning financial management with AI tools has been both an insightful and eye-opening experience. At first, I was skeptical about relying on AI, thinking it might just provide quick answers without really helping me understand the material. Over time, however, I realized that when used correctly, AI can be a powerful learning partner. It helped me break down complex financial concepts—like budgeting, time value of money, and investment comparisons—into simpler, step-by-step explanations. For example, when I was struggling with cash-flow analysis, I used an AI tool to walk me through each part of the calculation, and it made the process much clearer. On the positive side, AI offered instant feedback, saved time, and gave me multiple ways to approach a problem. It also encouraged me to think critically by allowing me to test different financial scenarios, like buy vs. rent or loan payoff strategies. On the downside, I noticed that AI sometimes gave generic or overly simplified answers, and I had to double-check its accuracy using my class notes or textbook. This taught me that AI shouldn't replace understanding—it should enhance it. for example, having ai create calculators for us and help us make financial decisions on buy vs rent and when to invest helps is very useful and AI helps enhance my learning outcomes"
"Using AI tools in this class has taught me how broaden the scope of ways I could be utilizing it in my daily life. I initially just saw it as a tool that could answer questions that I am having a difficult time with but in reality this semester I've learned how I can use it to see a new perspective on items that aren't really difficult but can be shown a new perspective on. Using it as a learning partner has shown me how AI can be used to challenge your mindset on a item, it doesn't consider how much you like or don't like doing something. Specifically I can say that when we were learning how to automate figuring out ways to maximize your stock portfolio, I had a very block by block mindset where I didn't feel comfortable expanding the places my money was going to much, but using AI and coding to simulate different outcomes outside of my comfort zone taught me how important it can be."
"I have mixed feelings about learning financial management with AI tools this semester. I feel as though it is very useful using AI in certain situations where I don't know how to go about starting a problem. It gives me an idea of how I can go about answering the problems and give me a push in the right direction. The problem I have with using AI in financail management is that it sometimes does not give me the right outputs, especially with calculations. For instance, in one of the assignments the professor told me that one of my calculations was incorrect and that marked me down points, which became frustrating because I have to rely heavily on AI when it comes to hard calculations. I have learned what to trust when using AI as a learning partner and how to verify that AI is giving the right outputs."
"I think my mindset about Ai has changed from just it doing all the work for me, but instead having Ai assist me in my work. Being able to use AI to automate financial calculations is super helpful when trying to focus on specific outcomes using the DRIVER framework. For instance, my 2nd mini-project was super helpful in giving specific questions and then giving a financial wisdom. AI is very helpful for automation in those areas."
"My mindset has started to like AI more not necessarily for financial management but also  just learning all the practical applications it can be used for example emails, picture, etc. I have learned that you can use Ai to enhance or assist in your learning to get a more well rounded idea of whatever topic you are researching such as if I don't know what a certain word means in financial management I can ask AI to provide to definition and an example."
"You stopped this response

that its been good
That's great to hear that it's been a good experience for you! It sounds like you're in a good position to write a strong reflection.

Based on your prompt, you need to articulate why it was good, focusing on your mindset and specific learning strategies. Here is a sample reflection that models how you could structure your own thoughts. You can use this as a template and swap in your own specific examples from your financial management course.

Reflection: My Semester Learning Finance with an AI Partner
This semester, integrating AI tools into my financial management studies wasn't just helpful—it fundamentally changed my approach to learning. Initially, I was skeptical, but my experience has been overwhelmingly positive, shifting my mindset and equipping me with new, effective learning strategies.
My Evolving Mindset: From ""Magic 8-Ball"" to ""Co-Pilot""
At the start of the semester, I viewed AI (like ChatGPT or Gemini) as a ""magic 8-ball""—a tool for getting quick, simple answers. I'd ask it ""What is the formula for the Sharpe Ratio?"" and just copy the answer. I was wary of its accuracy for complex topics and saw it as a shortcut, not a genuine learning partner.
My mindset has completely changed. I now see AI as a collaborative learning partner, or a ""co-pilot."" The crucial shift happened when I realized AI's strength isn't just giving answers, but helping me explore them. It's a patient, 24/7 tutor that I can ask to re-explain a concept in five different ways without it getting frustrated. It's a sounding board for my own ideas, helping me refine my understanding before I ever get to class.

What I Learned: Using AI Effectively

This mindset shift was driven by learning how to use the tool effectively. Here are the key strategies I developed:

Iterative Questioning: I stopped asking for simple definitions. Instead, I learned to build understanding layer by layer.
Example (Time Value of Money): I didn't just ask, ""What is TVM?"" I started a conversation:
""Explain the concept of Time Value of Money in simple terms.""
""Okay, now show me the formula for Present Value (PV) and explain each component.""
""Give me a practical example: If I need $10,000 in 5 years for a down payment and can get a 6% annual return, how much do I need to invest today?""
""What happens to that number if inflation is 3%?"" This iterative process turned a abstract formula into a concrete, usable tool.

AI as a Simulator: This was a game-changer for me, especially for risk management.
Example (Portfolio Management): I would ask the AI to ""Act as a financial advisor. My portfolio is 60% stocks (S&P 500) and 40% bonds (U.S. Treasurys). What is the likely impact on my portfolio if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 0.50%? Explain your reasoning."" This ""what-if"" scenario planning made the theoretical relationship between interest rates and asset prices feel real and tangible.
Concept ""Translator"": Financial textbooks and articles can be incredibly dense.
Example (WACC): When I was struggling with the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), I pasted a dense textbook definition into the AI and prompted it: ""Explain this to me like I'm a 10th grader starting a small business."" It broke down the jargon (like ""cost of equity"" and ""cost of debt"") into simple terms about bank loans and investor expectations, making the entire concept click.
A ""Smarter"" Study Guide: Instead of just re-reading notes, I used the AI to actively test myself.
Example (Exam Prep): I would prompt it with, ""I'm studying for a financial management exam. Ask me 10 questions about capital budgeting, including net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). Don't give me the answers until I try first."" This active recall was far more effective than passive reading.

In conclusion, this semester taught me two things: financial management, and how to learn with AI. My mindset has shifted from seeing AI as a simple tool for answers to seeing it as a powerful partner for exploration. The key is not what you ask it, but how you ask—by being specific, iterative, and creative, I've unlocked a new way of learning that I know I'll use long after this course is over.

way shorterThis semester, I learned a lot about both finance and AI. My mindset changed from seeing AI as just an ""answer finder"" to viewing it as a real learning partner.
At first, I'd just ask for quick definitions. Now, I know its real value is in how I use it. For example, when studying the Time Value of Money (TVM), I stopped just asking ""What is the formula?"" Instead, I'd ask it to explain the concept simply, then give me a practice problem, and then ask ""what if"" scenarios (like changing the interest rate). This iterative process made the concept stick.
I also learned to use it as a study-prep tool. I'd prompt it: ""Ask me 10 questions about capital budgeting,"" and then have it check my answers. This active recall was far more effective than just re-reading my notes.
Overall, it's been a great experience. I've learned that AI is a powerful collaborator for learning, not just a shortcut."
"Before this class, I didn't use too much AI, especially for financial models and more technical equations such as what we do in class. I think overall it can be a great too, however it is important for people to understand what the AI computes beforehand to clearly communicate what the output is. My mindset overall has shifted in the ways that I thought AI would work hand-in-hand with jobs; again, its a great tool to use together, but I don't see hope for it to completely take over human-ran jobs. If there's anything I've learned so far, it's that AI doesn't necessarily do a great job of listening, no matter how clear your prompt is, and how sometimes it can still be inaccurate. An example would be all the times we prompt Gemini to output python code; within the last two assignments, I would receive broken code that did not run. It was my job to calculate where exactly the AI got it wrong, to then train it to output actual working code. 

Once again, AI can be great. But, it's still our job to train them to be great and to effectively use them with our own work. It is important to not only rely on it, as there is a clear gap between people who only rely on it, and people who use their own skills to accompany it."
"My mindset has definitely changed about ai from this class, I always thought it was a replacement for workers but now I feel like it is a tool for people to enhance what they do in the workforce. I leanned that ai is extremely useful for coding purposes through the multiple assignments we have done using python."
"It has made it both challenging and easy to learn at the same time. When i can properly command AI to assist me in tasks, it really does help me learn faster, effectively and efficiently. However it can be a common struggle to use it when I do not formulate AI prompts or other services correctly and can make it difficult to troubleshoot. When it is giving me a problem it can take away from the finance to focus more upon the AI but when it does work, it accelerated my financial learning. An example from the course was the n8n model. It was very difficult to troubleshoot if it gave you an error you didn't know. But once you got it working it was very easy to improve upon."
"My mindset on AI has stayed the same, as I try not to use it as a crutch all of the time. I think it's fine to use it for quick calculations. I've learned that AI can give you broader ideas to help you summarize what has been going on. For mini project 2, using AI can be effective in figuring out what your budget is and how much taxes affect your budget. I think using Python code can be effective, as it shows the code figuring out the equations in real time."
"This semester has gone really well. I came into the course already interested in AI, but working through financial management problems using AI tools gave me a much better sense of how to actually apply them in a practical way. My mindset shifted from seeing AI as just a ""helper"" for answers to seeing it as more of a learning partner to understand concepts better."
"Using AI tools this semester has changed my mindset completely. Before, I used Ai to write small responses or help me brainstorm for projects. But this semester helped me learn how to correctly use AI, to advance my thoughts and knowledge. It helps me outline projects and create potential ideas. It's as if i'm talking to someone who is a professional in a certain department. AI helps me work through a problem and to completely understand the topic. During this course specifically, AI has helped me write code for the Mini Projects, brainstorm ideas for the session assignments and much more. In other classes AI helps me study for exams or even help with simple homework problems."
"My experience with learning financial management with Ai tools this semester has defenetly between unique and different. I would have never expected how powerful AI truly can be and how we can use it to be a power tool as well. I remember learning from Professor Zhang that a humans mind combined with AI is very powerful. My mindset has differently changed around AI. I used to think it was over complicated and a waste of time. Now since I have learned how to use It and manipulate it, it is something that I am comfortable with and use on the daily basis. For example how we use Google Gemini during our session assignments to create python scripts for us and help us present to audience about out findings and learnings."
"I have really enjoyed my experience learning financial management with AI tools this semester. I believe that Prof Zhang's core push to incorporate AI into our learning and use it as a helping hand in finance is very strong perspective that covers the financial theory and prepares us to be advanced in utilizing AI to improve our skillset to work in the finance industry. Entering this class from my Computer Science classes, I have changed my stance on AI from AI is harmful to learning, to AI is a great tool that helps enhance learning in the classroom if used properly. I have learned how to prompt effectively with AI models through continuously practicing the DRIVER framework on our homework assignments and mini projects. In my homework assignments, I have used AI to complete each step of DRIVER where in my implementation I have scripted my prompts to include the formulas for the calculations, the market conditions, and alternative scenarios of changes we can face in the time period that has supported my learning to not just learn to code the solution, but also that in finance there is always external factors that make an impact to the final decision as well. I would say that the strongest use of AI where I really realized Prof Zhang's ideal was Mini Project 2 where I built an AI Agent to handle mortgage calculations for real estate properties to compare mortgage and equity to make the right investment as a first-time home buyer. Overall, I would love to continue my AI powered journey in finance."
"Throughout this semester, learning financial management with AI tools has completely changed the way I view both finance and technology. At first, I saw AI as something distant or too advanced, but now I see it as a powerful learning partner. Using AI tools like Gemini helped me understand concepts such as compound interest, risk analysis, bonds, stock valuation in a more interactive and personalized way by implementing AI tools that collect information and help organize it. Instead of just memorizing formulas, I could ask AI to explain results, visualize data, and connect financial decisions to real-world outcomes. This experience taught me that AI doesn't replace learning it enhances it by making complex ideas more accessible and engaging. I believe AI is a great tool for financial decisions and questions."
"My experience using AI to assist in my learning of financial concepts and financial management as a field has been transformative. Viewing the recent news to come out of Accenture and Walmart and JPMC about their usage of AI and how it's transforming the experience of workers- especially finance professionals has left me with an innate yet new sense of curiosity about AI, the workforce, and how I will use it in my career. AI is a game of speed- meaning that if you will be left behind if you don't implement AI into your company's financial workflows to speed up, automate, enhance, and validate your work via creating internal AI & python driven products and tools your company can use to improve the quality of its analysis. That sentiment has been reinforced over the duration of this course and I couldn't be more grateful because the news that I read on a daily basis solidifies and provides a literal basis for the importance of this concept to stand on. My mindset originally was relatively dismissive and framed AI as an All-In-One tool that does most of the heavy lifting and critical thinking for the user- yet this course's DRIVER assignments teaches you that couldn't be further from the truth. We've been able to use AI in analyses on portfolio structuring and creation while at the same time in my DRIVER assignment on portfolio structure, correlation between two stocks and ETFs, how to interpret sharpe rations, expected return, and volatility given unique the goals of an imaginary scenario. However, going beyond this, this course has allowed me to apply and give context to the news I read on the markets, geopolitical events and on technology so that I can both organically understand financial management concepts and the news more in depth."
"While I still have my skepticisms regarding AI, I have learned that the it can be an incredible tool if used appropiately and responsibly. AI is trained to give us the answers that we want, even if they may not be accurate. Thus, the V in DRIVER, Validate, becomes an important factor when using AI. Information must consistently be checked against other known, credible sources on the internet or otherwise. While completing my assignments and projects, it was important to validate certain estimates and rates through external sources without blindly trusting what the AI platform was giving me. The breadth of what I can accomplish with AI has expanded vastly throughout my time in the course, but it has also opened my eyes to the various constraints that the programs can have. Using AI effectively means using it responsibly. Additionally, I have learned the importance AI will hold in future labor markets and how adapting/growing with the new technologies will ensure that I remain hireable with the upcoming changes to labor demands."
"When working alongside with AI, I have learned that the better you prompt your chat box, the better the response. I always make sure to use DRIVER framework when asking my question by including all information possible. My mindset has improved on AI this semester so far. I used AI a lot before this class, but now I feel I have unlocked new possibilities with AI I didn't know I could do."
I think my mindset about AI has changed because now i have started using AI not just to find answers but to understand concepts using it. Using Ai just to find a solution isn't the best but using it as a learning partner or understanding concepts from it really helps in learning. For example using AI to explain financial concepts in the weekly videos makes it easier to explain what we are learning in class.
My mindset about AI has changed a lot throughout the semester. First off I think of AI as a tool to help me learn. AI can teach you mostly everything with steps included; if I'm ever stuck on a problem AI can teach me how to solve whatever problem I'm facing. In this course we use AI to help create code and understand what the code does. I enjoy how we have AI solve for a certain scenario and then prove it by solving it ourselves. It helps prove that we are correct.
At the start of this semester I thought that Ai was just a shortcut or type of google for quick answers. But as I have moved through this course I learned that AI is a tool and a partner for moving through and solving complex problems. Some people feel that Ai will reduce critical thinking skills but I belive that it strengthens them. It helps me to be sure and verify my results and not be passive. This course has deepened my understanding and approach to financial mangement with creativity.
"This semester, using AI tools helped me understand financial management concepts more clearly and quickly. My mindset changed from seeing AI as just a calculator to viewing it as a real learning partner. For example, I used AI to explain budgeting and ratio analysis in simple terms, which made studying much easier."
"Learning financial management with AI technologies this semester has been enlightening and, to be honest, a little draining. At the beginning of the semester, I thought AI was a magical shortcut that could fix problems or simplify assignments right away. However, my perspective changed after completing the AI Pizza Portfolio project. My patience was particularly put to the test by that project because it has taken a long time, cost money, and the system doesn't always function as intended. It helped me realize that artificial intelligence isn't a panacea; its effectiveness depends on how you use it and how well you comprehend the underlying concepts.


I learned a lot about efficiently using AI as a learning partner rather than a crutch, despite the frustrating experience. For instance, rather than only requesting responses, I began using AI to verify my thinking while evaluating various financial models or creating scenarios for portfolio risk and return. After entering my Python code or Excel calculations, I would ask the AI to interpret the results in terms of money. I was able to comprehend ideas like diversification, expected return, and the risk-reward trade-off thanks to that back and forth.

Additionally, I've discovered that while AI tools can help me organize my reports, scripts, and graphics and are excellent for brainstorming, they cannot take the place of my own critical thinking. I wind up wasting more time correcting mistakes than learning if I rely on it mindlessly. I now view AI more as a partner that can expedite tasks when I know what I'm doing, rather than as a substitute for human labor.
In summary, I learned in this class that while AI is strong, it is not magic. It's a tool, and if you maintain control, challenge its results, and place your own judgment at the heart of the process, it may be immensely beneficial for financial management."
"Throughout this semester, I have learned how to use different AI tools as a resource for complex business concepts. At first, I thought of AI with a negative connotation or a tool people relied it. Now, I see it as a tool for positive results and as a learning partner. I have been able to use GoogleProGemini and AI tools on n8n and other app sites that have assisted with programming. The use of AI has helped me with efficiently, professionalism, and the overall results of my projects and tasks. It refines my skills and codes to work well with my tasks. I realized that using AI interatively has helped as a learning partner. Learning to use it and guide it has been really involving and helps with the learning process as well. With my experience with the course, I was able to use AI on n8n to help with the app I was building. I wanted to generate an easy understanding of investments and how they will result in the long run. I was able to use AI to help my code and generate different reiterations to 1. generate my purpose and 2. make it look professional. These aspects pushed my curiosity and helped me understand why these formulas worked. I also asked AI in the past to help my session assignments in creating different reiterations for practice problems which helped me better understand each week's lessons and applying the concepts to real world financial statements."
"My mindset about AI has stayed similar to what I thought at the beginning of the semester, which is that it is very helpful in terms of interpreting information and helping provide solutions to specific problems, but still hallucinates a lot and can be hard to trust. Specifically, for many of the assignments, colab does a great job of interpreting what I want it to do and the information I am trying to get, but it has trouble actually implementing the information I give it. Sometimes it won't include inputs I give it or it will just make up random inputs throughout the code. With the second mini project, I had a hard time trying to make it do automatic calculations because it messed up so much, even when I gave it the formula it was supposed to use. I've learned that, to effectively use AI as a learning partner, you have to thuroghly check its work, because it can make a lot of mistakes if you're not careful."
"I think that my mindset has definitely shifted positively. With AI, I'm learning how to do a lot more advanced work while actually understanding what I'm doing. For example, with my mini project 2, I was able to do it but at the same time, comprehend what I was doing on a deeper level because of my AI prompt that makes sure to explain the step-by-step process and logical reasoning behind each step. Something I learned about using AI effectively though is making sure you're putting in the same amount of work as it is; you're not just inputting the work for AI to do, but you're doing your own work and AI is enhancing it and the process of doing it."
"This lesson transformed AI from simply providing answers into a learning tool for me. While learning to build financial automation tools in n8n, I applied theories like the time value of money and cash flow analysis to practice. Using AI to simulate portfolio analysis scenarios deepened my understanding of the relationship between risk and return. I realized that the effectiveness of AI depends on how I ask questions—the more specific and contextualized the prompts, the more in-depth the analysis. It doesn't replace human judgment but helps me make better financial decisions through structured thinking. Because AI can also make mistakes, we cannot rely on it completely; we still need to exercise our own judgment."
"Before this semester, I simply treated AI tools as an encyclopedia, asking questions and having it answer them. However, I now see AI as a true learning partner, helping me think more deeply, guiding me step-by-step rather than just providing quick answers, and solving many problems by following the DRIVER framework. For example, in Mini Project 2, I wanted to create an intelligent investment advisor. I asked my AI partner for specific operating methods, and it guided me step-by-step, correcting problems as they arose, ultimately creating a working tool. This was very rewarding, and I'm very grateful to my AI partner. AI is not just a question-and-answer tool; it allows me to easily learn about areas I've never explored before, which is truly novel and gives me a sense that I can actually build something.
I also discovered that the output of AI depends on how clearly I define and describe my needs. For example, by testing my tools in different investment scenarios, I learned to carefully examine formulas, interpret outputs, and make appropriate adjustments. Overall, this experience taught me that effectively utilizing artificial intelligence requires human judgment, curiosity, and critical thinking. AI has not replaced learning; on the contrary, it has enhanced learning by helping me connect theoretical financial concepts with practical applications and has also greatly supported practice."
"I have learned a variety of financial management concepts but I don't understand why so much focus on AI when the majority of students will not use it in their careers. It would make more sense if our majors were computer science or finance. Nonetheless, my mindset about AI has changed slightly for the better. I have gained a better understanding on how I could effectively use AI to calculate problems. For example, using AI to determine whether it would be financially smart to rent at the current place vs another apartment was a real world problem that AI solved."
"I started embracing using AI tools for financial analysis. Although it's not always trustworthy about online statistics, it can provide helpful information and thorough analysis when prompted. For example, I'm not a great coder myself, to say the very least. And whenever I reach out to AI to get help with coding, it always delivers something that achieves the purpose and marks up each part of the code to tell me what it does. Additionally, I love how it can verify its own calculations when I ask it to, and it can also tell me what other methods I can use to further verify my findings."
"My mindset revolving around AI has gotten sharper and has shifted to more of a priority than it used to be. I have learned how many ways it getting implemented into the business industry and how it will continue to evolve in the world around us. I also learned it is important to stay up to date with the newest AI news and also learn the fundamentals about how it works. I have learned how to effectively use AI as a partner by implementing the DRIVER method to my research and projects, such as in optimizing portfolios, calculating different valuations methods and more importantly, learning how to actually build AI agents and prompt engineer for efficient outputs."
"My experience so far has been so interesting. I have thoroughly enjoy this class and the projects. My mindset on AI has changed tremendously. I always knew AI was amazing but it is so cool to see all the different use cases. It also is very user friendly. Some things like today's project was really difficult, but everything else has been great. I think creating my own agent is super interesting and useful."
"I think my mindset around AI has evolved, specifically because of the calculations I am able to generate through the Python notebooks we generate with colab. I learned that AI is a great learning partner, but it takes some prompting to get it to answer in a beneficial way to me."
I have learned a bit more about how to use AI as a tool to help create new things while still being in charge and running the thinking. It has helped me to explore more deeply into different topics and to help me understand more.
"Before this class, my experience with AI only revolved around ChatGPT and Google's implemented AI feature. I was not aware of the ways to further use these resources or how to actually develop skills using them. This class showed me various ways to effectively utilize AI systems to enhance my own knowledge and resources. My favorite ways I've learnt to use AI are using Gemini to create an app, using Colab, and n8n cloud to create your own version of an AI. All these experiences helped further my understanding of not only technology, but also finance. It taught me not to depend on the AI but to actually engage with it purposefully to obtain results that I can expect, not just hope that they come up."
"I really appreciate how AI is not only normalized but is also one of the key parts of this course. AI use is rapidly increasing, and as students, now is the time to learn how and when to use it. My mindset about AI before this course has changed completely. Last year, I always felt that using AI meant it was cheating and bad, and that I should never use it. Now, I feel as though AI is only bad if used incorrectly.

From this course, we use AI to help with coding, which is needed for those similar to me who have almost no experience with it. We also use AI tools to help us brainstorm ideas for projects and submissions. The goal is not to just copy and paste AI and be done. I see the goal as learning from AI and then expanding more with your own thoughts and ideas.For example, for this reflection, there was no AI use until I asked ChatGPT to edit for grammar and punctuation only and keep my tone and writing the same. I am grateful this class lets me explore more of the great things AI has to offer."
"I feel that I have definetly changed my mind about AI. This class has opened my mind to the vast world of AI and how much implications it can have in the modern world. i initially thought that chatgpt and gemini were the only things that were the only main AI devices that were important or good. However, after learning how to use tools like n8n cloud and underwstanding how to write prompts better. It seems that AI is much more effective in terms of learning in a new way."
"How I Feel About AI Now

Before this class, I thought AI was... (Examples: just a faster Google, not very useful, only for simple answers, a ""cheating"" tool)

Now, I think AI is... (Examples: a helpful tutor, a brainstorming partner, a tool I need to guide carefully, useful for complex problems)
Examples are how for ever single assignment I use i to clarify what I need to do and how to execute it as good as I can"
"This semester changed how I see AI in finance. At first, I thought it was just a tool for quick answers, but I learned it can actually help me understand concepts better. When I built my AI finance project, I realized how useful it is for explaining financial logic, not just doing math. I learned how to write clear prompts and use AI to test real situations like buying versus renting. Now I see AI as a learning partner that helps me think deeper and learn more effectively."
"At the beginning of the course, I saw AI as something used for quick answers or simple calculations. But, as I started using it more intentionally for problem-solving, explanations, and project development, I realized how powerful it can be as a learning partner rather than just a shortcut or an easy way out. I have also learned how to work with AI as a partner. Through the mini project #1, I have learned that AI can help create apps that can be successful in the real world scenarios. I used AI as a partner, and creating an app is never something that I thought I would be capable of without extensive background knowledge, but though the power of AI, I was able to use it to help me create useful financial calculators."
"I feel like overall I like using AI with financial managment because it is relevant for the future as most things will likely be AI automated. Mini project 2 was especially interesting using automation tools to create a finance tool, I feel like this is an easy and efficient way to do repetitive calculations. Learning this is easier with a learning partner as we navigate the tools together."
"This semester, learning financial management alongside AI tools completely changed how I think about both finance and technology. At the beginning of the course, I saw AI mostly as a tool for answering questions or doing quick calculations. Now, I see it as a real learning partner—something that can help me understand, build, and even explain financial concepts in my own words.

One of the biggest lessons I learned was during the mini-projects. For example, when I built an AI mortgage calculator using n8n, I realized how AI can take a complicated financial formula—like the mortgage payment equation—and make it accessible to anyone. The process of connecting the math with the AI explanation taught me that understanding why a number matters is just as important as calculating it. It made financial management feel less like memorizing formulas and more like solving real problems.Throughout the course, I also learned how to communicate better with AI. Writing clear prompts, giving context, and testing different phrasing showed me that the quality of my thinking directly affects the quality of AI's responses. When I used AI to study topics like risk and return or time value of money, it wasn't just giving me answers—it was guiding me to reason through each step."
"its made me put more belief and trust into Ai, must have to know to properly use but it definitely is very effective"
"This class is unlike any class I have taken. My mind set about ai being more of a tool and less of an aid has definetley developed from this class. I now know how to use ai effectively to help me do problems, instead of using it to just do it for me. Knowing the equations but having ai do it saves time, but still shows i know the concepts. If i am confused on something, I can use ai to explain things so i actually learn more then i would have without ai. All in all I think ai has been a great tool for me in this course when learning time value of money and has shown me a new way to figure out problems."
"My mindset towards AI has changed significantly. I kind of was limited with the way I could use AI but now since taking this class I realize there is so much more it could do, like for example create code to do calculations. I think I have learned that AI can help you if you put effort into helping it understand what you want. This means that to get better AI output you need to make sure your AI prompts are good and that they Cleary describe what you want. I think this is clearly shown in the mini projects, as we are asked in these projects to do multiple loops so that we can create the best project, whether that be an app or an AI model. Overall, I have definitely learned more about AI and have realized that there is a lot that can be done with it."
"Throughout this semester, my experience learning financial management with AI tools has been mixed. While I understand the value of using AI to improve efficiency and access information quickly, I often felt like it took away from the actual learning process. Many of the tasks that would have helped me develop real problem solving and critical thinking skills were handled by the AI, which made it feel like I wasn't truly understanding the material as deeply as I wanted to.


My mindset about AI hasn't changed much I still see it as a useful tool, but I believe it should be used to support learning rather than replace it. For example, when using AI to analyze financial data or explain formulas, it gave me quick answers but didn't always help me grasp why those answers were correct. I've learned that to use AI effectively as a learning partner, I have to ask deeper questions and take time to verify and apply what it provides instead of just accepting the results.
Overall, this course showed me that while AI can make tasks easier, real understanding still comes from engaging with the material myself."
"After being halfway through the semester, my mindset about AI had changed. My mindset on AI has been more driven toward how important it is and how it will revolutionize how the world functions in the Finance industry, and in general. As a learning partner, I have learned 

that we must train the AI to use it effectively because it is not as smart as we believe it is. 
Some specific examples I have are when we asked AI about 2 different mortgage scenarios when we were on the real estate and mortgages chapter, and I learned that the AI machines were not able to think outside of the box because they did not consider certain factors within the scenarios. For instance, it did not take into account that we could lower the principal instead of reducing the APR payment, which would create an entirely new scenario that the AI machine could not factor in. So, what I had to do was feed that information to the AI so it could view it from on outside of the box perspective, which helped me use it more effectively."
"In this semester, I realized AI really changed from a shortcut to a thinking partner for me. I use AI to help me turn a correlation table and volatilities into a covariance matrix in my portfolio assignment. In my EPS assignment, AI also helped me to made a small EPS examples so I could test different situations. I learned to give AI a clear instruction, goal and define variables."
"I was never really a huge AI user so this course has definitely changed that for me. I have learned how to effectively create prompts, like all of the assignments and getting Gemini to effectively create what I need in Colab. It's easy to just paste the assignment but being able to have specific ideas and have AI help implement them has been new for me."
"My mindset of AI has definitely changed throughout this course. I went into this thinking, what's the point of just using AI for everything, but in reality, AI is going to be our future, and it's a good idea to get a head start and actually learn how to use it correctly and efficiently. I really enjoy this class because I get a lot of freedom on my assignments, and a lot of these things are really useful for managing your money when you get an actual job and you have to think about long-term investments. Ex: time value of money, retirement, and risk vs return on stocks. These are all very useful future values to understand and master."
"AI tools can either help of hurt your work. I think prompting AI is very effective but having it brainstorm for you and actually be the creative side to your ideas is detrimental not just ot us but when we go into the workforce. I have learned that using AI effectively as a learning partner can speed up understanding of complex topics and is really good for summarization but it can't force you to learn. For example, in class I use AI to ask questions that the professor asks that I do not necessarily understand or top of my mind exactly know. Another example would be how I prompt the AI in the driver framework for assignments to better comprehend the code."
"My perspective on AI shifted from viewing it as a simple information tool to a personalized, active learning partner during the financial management course. I learned that asking highly specific, contextual questions like calculating a bond's price with set coupon and yield rates yielded far more instructional value than vague prompts. The most critical step for effective learning was the iterative process of asking ""Why"" and ""What if"" after an answer, which forced the AI to explain the underlying financial principles. This approach helped me transition from merely memorizing formulas to genuinely understanding the economic logic behind decisions like leverage and diversification. Ultimately, AI proves to be an excellent learning accelerator when you use it to apply and challenge your knowledge, not just retrieve facts."
"I have learned the balance of understanding and using AI. I use to rely too much on AI and not understand what the output was, but now I have learned to learn and understand with AI. I have found the balance in this class."
"My experience learning financial management with AI tools this semester has been very positive. My mindset about AI has shifted, and this class really opened my eyes to how common and encouraged it is to use AI to write code and build financial tools. I've always been a fan of AI in industry, but I used to believe it was more ""commendable"" to code and build everything manually. I've since learned that this isn't the most effective mindset because what truly matters is understanding AI and using it as a tool. For example, I discussed a financial tool I built for an assignment that creates a retirement portfolio during an interview, and I realized that being able to prompt effectively, verify outputs, and apply them makes you highly valuable. The interview went really well! Overall, I my view and relationship of AI has strengthened from this course!"
My mindeset on AI has changed and has went from being slightly useful to really useful. I am starting to use it more. Before I also used it do do stuff for me. Now I use it to help me do stuff. I have also learned that using AI effectively can be really important since it gets you used to the AI and the topic without having AI do it for you.
"My experience learning financial managment with AI tools has been positive so far, I am learning ways to use AI outside of schools doing tasks to help me be more efficient. I have learned that Is is very good at explaining general topics that I do not understand, it can struggle with topics it is not fimiliar with if you are not specific. From what I have learned from this course I have asked Ai to help be understand concepts people you use investing, like looking at finanical reports to see if the company would be a good long term investment"
"This class's experience learning financial management with AI tools has been enlightening and refreshing. The process of teaching me financial ideas has made difficult subjects like investment analysis, valuation, and budgeting more approachable and interesting for me. Instead of learning concepts by heart, using AI pushed me to consider financial decisions more critically and consider different viewpoints. In order to improve knowledge, I also learnt how to employ AI as a learning partner by asking follow-up questions, confirming information, and providing examples. All in all, it changed my perspective so that I now see AI as a powerful tool for inquiry rather than only convenience. My trust in using financial principles to solve practical issues has also increased as a result. I now view AI as a guide that not replaces but helps with my learning."
"This semester, AI became more than just a calculator—it turned into a financial reasoning partner. When analyzing whether my grandmother should invest in bonds or stocks, AI helped simulate risk scenarios and calculate returns under different market conditions, which made my recommendation more data-driven. In another project comparing buying versus renting a house, AI tools helped me model mortgage payments, equity growth, and opportunity costs clearly. Overall, I learned that AI is most effective when used to test assumptions, visualize outcomes, and support real financial decisions."
"I would say that this has been my most interesting and challenging class this semester. I have always used Ai since it has came out but, this class finally makes me think of it as a tool and not just someone doing the work for me. For instance, the DRIVER framework allows me to guide myself and the Ai through our projects. I also really like the class structure that Professor Zhang does. Monday's are understanding and little Ai, Wednesdays are Ai and peer learning days, Friday we throw it all together. Although it is the same cycle every week it never feels repetitive. Instead, in this class it feels efficient. I am very thankful for Professor Zhang pushing me to be my best while still giving positive feedback and not being to hard on us. He stresses growth, not instant results. This has helped me in all my other classes and I am very thankful for this experience. I hope the rest of the semester goes just as great!"
My learning experience so far this semester has been very productive using AI for financial management. I have been more self sufficient when using AI to learn because it can explain it and break it down for me. Putting the information into code has also helped me visualize what is going on in the financial process. My mindset has changed about AI because every time I use it i see more opportunity for growth academically. I've learned that in order to use it as a learning partner you must train it and teach it to achieve success. Some examples are when we did the rent vs buy a place to live and I trained it to calculate for all of the possible costs and find what was actually the smart financial decision.
"I feel that AI has really helped me to better understand the financial content in this class and being able to use it to my benefit is very helpful. I feel that this skill of being able to tie in AI with what you are doing in life is going to be very big in the future and it is a skill that is good to learn right now. I feel like my view on AI has changed somewhat as before I only saw it as a way of giving you answers, but now I see it as a tool that you can use to collaborate with on problems that you are trying to solve. An example of using AI so far this semester that really helped me was anytime I would have to code and solve for complicated equations. An example of this would be using AI to help solve for the weekly video assignments and help me understand better. In session 5 I used AI to help solve for whether or not a housing situation was affordable. I bring this session up because I could use this in the future when I am making my own financial decisions such as buying or renting my first home."
So had been very influential and I am able to use it to learn finance in this class. It's Ben pretty cool to see what I can accomplish with it's guidance
"The course has started to grow on me as we learn more about topics relevant to me and my current life situation, from managing finances to making smart investment decisions. My use of AI has also improved significantly. I can now use detailed AI prompts to solve any problems I run into in my daily life, and I can validate and expand on them using DRIVER application. I know many fear AI and the future of it, but I agree with what we originally discussed in class, which is that we have to adopt and grow with AI so we don't get left behind. I am getting into day trading and investments in general, and the AI knowledge I've gained while in this course has helped significantly. In our 1st mini project, I learned how to create an interactive app with a simple AI prompt and expand on the app by further editing the prompt. I went on to make another app on my own time that will observe current market conditions of any stock or bond I input and give me a prediction on future price movement. The 2nd mini project, which I am about to complete, will show me how to work with AI agents to automate my stock and bond app and hopefully update the information onto a spreadsheet that is updated as the price moves."
"I have had a great experience gaining a deeper understanding of ai tools, and the applications where i can use them. My mindset has changed about ai in direct relation to working as my learning partner. I have learned how to correctly prompt the AI, and now i am a tremendous amount more successful and accurate when i use ai as a tool to deepen my understanding, rather than letting it be the reasoning of my understanding. Prompting AI to work based off my ideas for each of the video assignment has been a big help in making sure my work is accurate and based off what i believe the assignment is supposed to flow as"
"So far this semester, I have been enjoying the usage of AI with financial management. To be able to have a skill like these makes a student much more valuable when they apply for internship. At first, I completely had no clue what we were doing with CoLab and ""DRIVER"". I never understood how this would help me in the future. However, as time progressed I started to understand the details and answers to ""why"" in different financial scenarios. Specifically, in class I enjoyed being able to create my own code using Gemini and CoLab to create a loan calculator, or to see if I can afford to buy a condo or rent instead. My mindset has significantly changed from thinking differently on how to approach and answer the DRIVER framework."
"This semester, using AI while learning financial management really changed how I look at both studying and technology. At first, I mostly saw AI as something that could just give me quick answers when I got stuck. But as I started using it more, I realized it's actually a great tool for understanding why things work the way they do — not just what the answer is.
For example, when we went over financial ratios, I asked AI to explain how each one connects to a company's performance instead of just showing the formulas. That helped me see the bigger picture — like how liquidity and profitability ratios relate to a company's stability. When we got to topics like NPV and IRR, I used AI to break down the steps and walk through example problems. Seeing how small changes in discount rates or cash flows affected the results made the concepts way clearer. Over time, my mindset about AI shifted. I stopped treating it like a shortcut and started treating it like a study partner. I learned that how you ask questions really matters — the better the question, the better the explanation you get back. I also learned to double-check what it says instead of just copying it, which actually helped me understand the material more deeply.Overall, this course taught me that AI can be really helpful when you use it the right way. It makes learning more interactive, helps you practice explaining concepts in your own words, and pushes you to think instead of just memorize."
"I feel like before this class I had this mindset of ""using AI is bad"" because I feel like that was so drilled into my brain and I'm sure many others as well. We were always told AI is cheating, you shouldn't use it. Though, my perspective on it has changed a lot. Using AI in this course has taught me a lot and has led me to understand financial management a bit better. It has helped me tremendously come up with ideas to succeed on the weekly video assignments and on the first project we did."
"So far, using AI this semester has been helpful, while also frustrating at times. It is helpful to use when I am confused about a topic and need a more in-depth explanation. Sometimes it is difficult to use for the assignments because it does not always do what I am asking. Overall, my mindset about AI has stayed the same; it is useful, but not something to fully rely on."
"One thing that Has stuck out to me is that there is a really user friendly aspect of having ai speak finance. The barrier between layman and expert is much more easily bridged, and the complex analysis that would usually be very expensive to come across is at our fingertips. The downside to this is that ai doesn't always know what it is talking about, and can lead you astray very easily if you trust it blindly. For example on assignment 5 i was in a rush and for got to check the ai calculation for my project and my grade suffered because of it."
"The financial management class is good. I feel like AI is very beneficial and I am learning, and my mindset has stayed the same. So far I have learned how to integrate AI into my work. Something I don't like about this class is that there is no rubrics for the assignments and projects and sometimes I am confused as to what to do. AI is an effective learning partner. A specific example if when I used AI to analyze risks for investments."
"I believe my skills with AI have advanced significantly, and I have a deeper understanding of it. I enjoy learning about the rates and how to use AI to compare rates and stocks with each other. AI is very advanced and can make quick calculations and valuations for me. I want to learn how to apply this to real-life examples of stocks."
I think my mindset has changed i really did not get the point of using AI before we went through and i could see how i could use it for real world applications like using it for a mortgage payment calculator and just how i could use it to answer questions i needed help on.
"I've learned so much more about how AI can be used in productivity without completely relying on it. This course has taught me that while AI can speed up a process, it's new and bound to have issues that only a human mind can decode. Therefore, it's important to use AI as a tool and not a mindless servant. I've also learned how important DRIVER is and how it can help frame the work we do."
"This semester completely changed how I view AI in learning financial management. At first, I saw AI as a shortcut for solving problems or checking formulas. But over time, I began to use it as a true learning partner. 


For example, during the CAPM and bond valuation projects, AI helped me grasp how beta translates market volatility into company specific risk, instead of just giving me numbers. In the portfolio risk and return analysis, I used AI to test scenarios – like comparing Tesla, S&P 500, and Treasury bonds. This is to see how diversification reduces volatility. 
I also learned the value of asking better, more specific prompts. Instead of ""What is CAPM?"", I asked how it affects Netflix discount rate in a DCF model. That shift turned AI into a tutor rather than a mindless calculator.

Overall, I've learned that AI works best when used critically and collaboratively. It doesn't replace understanding, it strengthens it."
"My mindset hasn't really changed this semester. I have always thought that AI is useful when doing work, so this semester has just reinforced these thoughts in me. I have learned to use AI as a learning partner through better prompts. I have always used AI to learn, but with better and more thorough prompts, I have learned better."
"At the start of the semester, I was unsure how to feel about learning with AI tools. I was very worried to see how interactions between myself and the ai would go. At this point, I feel as though I know less about using AI than at the start of the semester; but in a way that I have learned that there is so much unknown about AI to still be explored. At the start of the semester I thought that AI was just a language model that spit out answers to questions that I gave it. Now I know that I can use it to code an interactive python script to compute financial analysis. This was particularly interesting in the portfolio building lessons as it was super cool for the AI to choose investment options based on its own code and how it was able to use my suggestions to interact with itself and its code. I am excited for the rest of the semester to continue to learn more about AI tools and learning with them."
"I feel like I've learned more about AI than I have about financial management. When I say this, I mean there is too much focus on the AI portion of the class. While I continue to think it is a valuable tool that offers new perspectives, I feel as though the heavy emphasis on learning about AI is creating a major disconnect with the core content of what Management 310 is supposed to be: financial management. Learning how to ask AI to code things from day 1 seems counterintuitive because we are now getting into more complex concepts with a very similar base knowledge. Passively reading AI responses and looking through AI generated code is not enough to learn this financial material in the depth I was expecting from this class."
"Using AI has definitely shifted my mindset and the way I see the new and potential ways to use it. Before, I saw it as just a cheat code which I am sure is what my parents first thought when the internet came out, but it does help and improve not only my understanding but it is mor efficient to use."
"My mindset on AI's capabilities has really changed since the beginning of this course. Getting my toes wet in different AI applications has taught me a lot about leveraging AI to refine and improve certain processes. Specifically, using the n8n application for mini project 2 revealed just a small amount of the power AI is capable of. While the model I made was relatively simple, I was able to grasp the potential the model had and what it could be used for. 

So far, I believe I have learned many practical, useful strategies for leveraging the modern AI tools that are available to us."
"I have gotten much more comfortable with using AI. I didn't know that it could output large amounts of code that help analyze data. This is just one of the many ways I have started using it this semester. Whenever I am struggling to understand a concept, I ask AI to explain it. It goes in depth walking me through it step by step. It has made me school life a lot easier and will continue to do so."
"My mindset has changed, I am more and more understanding and appreciating the approach. I also have found that with time I have a better grasp of the concepts because I am getting more used to the method of teaching in this course. For example earlier in the course I had trouble grasping concepts since I felt lost and didn't know how to navigate the GitHub for example. But now I know where to find everything and have the class schedule perfected into my own routine."
"As I get more and more exposure to AI, I become more attuned to how it benefits me in real time. I have learned that using AI to assist me in my work, the correct way, can only add to my prowess of technical abilities. I got to build an AI agent that helped me calculate FV of my investments."
"This semester, learning financial management with AI tools completely changed how I see technology in education. At first, I viewed AI as just a shortcut, but I realized it's more of a learning partner that helps me understand concepts faster and practice real applications. For example, using AI to analyze financial data and simulate investment decisions helped me connect theory with real-world insights. I learned that when used thoughtfully, AI doesn't replace learning, it enhances it."
"This semester, I learned how to use AI tools to understand financial management better. At first, I thought AI was just for quick answers, but I realized it can actually explain steps and help me think through problems, like using it to check formulas in Excel or explain concepts such as NPV or cash flow. My mindset changed because I started seeing AI as a study partner instead of a shortcut. I learned that using AI effectively means asking clear questions and double checking its work, just like I would with a classmate."
"My view on AI completely changed this semester. I started out thinking it was just a fancy calculator for getting quick answers, but now I see it as a true learning partner, especially for connecting finance concepts to Python. The key lesson was that I have to be the one in charge, asking smart, specific questions to get useful help. For example, instead of just asking for a formula for a stock valuation, I learned to ask the AI to explain the assumptions behind the formula and challenge my own analysis. This forced me to lead with my financial knowledge and use AI as a co-pilot to implement, validate, and deepen my understanding, rather than just getting answers."
I didn't realize how much AI systems there are out there and how much they are capable of. I realized this as I was doing the second project and all of the little things that went into making my project exactly how I wanted it to be with the outputs and inputs.
"I am more open to using AI to learn material as I see how it makes things easier to compute.  I focus less on the calculations of the numbers and more on the formulas and the reasons why you get to an answer.  AI is only as efficient as you communicate with it.  You have to know the right way to articulate the output you want from it and give it the proper inputs.  This recent mini project #2 definitely challenged me in doing that.  It took numerous attempts to do that, but practice makes perfect.  I am sure that in the near future AI will only increase in the workforce and the skills we learn in this class will be valuable.  This is the most unique course I have taken at Purdue, and it just might be one of the most important."
"Learning financial management with AI tools this semester helped me see AI as more than a way to get quick answers. I realized it can guide me through the reasoning behind topics like Risk & Return or stock valuation while still requiring me to verify results and understand the concepts. For example, when building valuation models, AI helped me structure the steps but I had to check the numbers and logic myself. I learned that AI is most effective when I use it as a partner to support my learning rather than replace it."
"AI tools like Google Colab and n8n have completely changed the way I view artificial intelligence. They've taught me to see AI not just as an answer-giving machine, but as a true assistant, something that helps me think, build, and create. Working with these tools has helped me understand AI's real capabilities and how to use it effectively and responsibly."
"I think the main takeaway I have had from using AI to solve these complex financial problems is that the combination of using AI with having foundational financial knowledge is as strong as having one of the best financial minds on the planet. If you are able to understand what different ratios mean, what causes a stock price to go up and down, and what the most important financial concepts are and translate that to AI, it can analyze data and tell you which stocks fit your criteria to invest in, what the best investment decision is, how much your money will be worth in the future, and almost every important financial concept that you can think of. This class has really expanded how I look at investments, and when I take in news about certain stocks from the news, I can give AI important formulas from yahoo finance and really get the whole big picture about a stock without just taking in one news source and running with it. The investment decision where we analyzed sharpe ratios, and the risk and return of given stocks, bonds and the S&P 500 was the most important, because I was able to use the given financial data and analyze the best stock decision simply based on that. When I factor that in with investing based on macro and sentiment respectively in my day to day investing, I feel like I have exponentially gotten better in my ability to understand the stock market as a whole."
"At the start of this course, I viewed AI as a quick way to get answers, but I've learned it's actually a powerful learning partner. Through assignments like Portfolio Risk & Return and Time Value of Money, AI helped me understand not just how to calculate results, but why the formulas work. When building my Python portfolio analysis, I used AI to debug code, explain diversification, and validate Sharpe ratio calculations. Instead of just solving problems, AI pushed me to think critically and connect theory to real data. I realized that diversification, risk, and return aren't just math—they're decision tools that shape real investments. Overall, AI helped turn finance from a numbers-heavy subject into an interactive way to explore, test, and communicate financial ideas."
"This semester shaped how I felt about AI. When the course began, I saw AI as a shortcut and something that generated answers to questions. Through the course topics like portfolio risk and return, time value of money and dividend discounts it made me realize AI can be used for way more than that and can actually be used as a tutor in some ways. When I built my python notebooks to analyze $10,000 investment portfolio AI would help create code, visualize corrections, and interpret risk and return tradeoffs. Instead of just copying formulas, I asked AI to walk me through each step. 

Overall, I've learned that AI isn't a replacement for thinking it's a tool that enhances problem solving, visualization and confidence. The key is using it to explore, test scenarios and communicate ideas clearly. This course showed me how AI can turn financial management from a math heavy subject into an interactive, creative and data driven experience."
"My mindset has stayed the same about AI. I think us using AI to learn finance should not be the point of the class and we should actually be learning normally. I'm personally struggling heavily to learn more about the softwares we are using and it feels like this is no longer a financial management class. Specially, this mini project 2 I couldn't tell you a single finance thing I learned. I also spent over 10+ hours just trying to figure out how to use the software and in the end caused me to miss the deadline. I was able to get my flow working once and then my computer crashed and erased everything where I couldn't even go back to my progress. I also wasn't able to recreate what I had as well. Overall, I think we need to die down on the software use and start to learn more of the basics of finance to help guide us better throughout the assignments. With little knowledge being learned from each class session and assignments increasing in difficulty, we will start to rely on AI more for the answers because we are so unsure of where to even begin. I think its okay to integrate software/AI but at a lesser volume than what we are currently utilizing it at. I personally knew little to no finance coming into this class and I believe I carry the same amount of knowledge in the subject due to the class being too AI/software driven."
"My thoughts about this course have definitely improved since the start of the course. Using AI in this course has taught me how to use it effectively in my other courses. For example, in my law course I was having trouble understanding a textbook section so I put it into gemini and had it simplify it for me. Because of financial management I knew what questions to ask the gemini to help prompt to me a better understanding of the textbook. In this course, I have learned how to ask questions about the formulas when necessary and how to use those to support my learning."
I have throughly enjoyed using ai to aid in certain hypothetical scenarios and help learn about certain topics in the financial world. My favorite part of this class so far is being able to create apps that I can uses to easily calculate financial calculations that are long and hard to do by hand. Ai would help design the app but I would tell it was specifically what I wanted to be included in the app and the different numbers I want to use when using the calculation.
"I definitely have a very different mindset on how to use AI today compared to the beginning of the semester. I knew how AI can practically do almost any problem but when you go more into detail on how you want it to be done, AI can perfect its answer to your needs. I never knew that using the DRIVER framework could help me organize the assignments and figure out what am I looking at, the next steps, the results, and the reflection. I feel that I have a better understanding on how different financial subjects work, such as interest rates, home equity, COGS and so much more. AI has become more of a learning partner than just a tool that can solve your problems. You can go deeper into how they did it and control what you want them to say. This class has taught me everything I need to know on how to use AI as a more helpful partner than just a resource."
"This semester completely shifted how I see AI in financial management. At the beginning, I thought of AI as just a quick way to get answers, like a faster calculator or research assistant. But as I started using it in our projects, especially while building my Loan Affordability Calculator, I realized AI can actually teach you how to think about finance more clearly. For example, when I used AI to check my loan formulas or explain debt-to-income ratios, it didn't just give me the right numbers, it helped me understand why those ratios matter and how changing one input shifts the bigger financial picture. My mindset changed from ""AI as a shortcut"" to ""AI as a learning partner."" I learned that if I ask detailed, well-structured prompts, like explaining my logic step by step or asking for comparisons, I get deeper insights and fewer generic answers. Throughout this course, I used AI to verify financial concepts, brainstorm automation ideas, and even debug formulas, which made me more confident in applying what I learned. It showed me that AI isn't replacing human judgment in finance, it's enhancing it, helping students like me move from just memorizing formulas to understanding how financial systems actually work."
"My mindset of AI has changed from using AI as a tool only for solving current problems in the present to solving long term problems in the future. This could include financial problems like when you want to invest and have multiple long term investment options, you can use AI to determine which investment option is most likely to give you the highest rate of return. You can also use the AI to provide a summary of the risk of each investment scenario as well as the benefits of each. We used AI to do this exact thing when comparing two different bonds for a previous assignment and comparing the overall rate of return."
"My mindset towards AI has changed due to the fact that I understand it is a tool. I has learned that there are skills that are able to be applied to assist me on my financial journey, along with others. It can be used to grasp the accumulative knowledge of financial outcomes along with coding for tools to predict the outcome of needed structures."
"During this course, I have definitely increased my AI knowledge and how it be used in different ways. I have learned about different platforms that can be used for different types of applications that I was not made aware of before. This has made me realize how useful and AI can be. I have learned how to apply the DRIVER framework as a learning partner to always use AI efficiently. Key part of that being  always validating the output. Specifically, I have been using Google Gemini, Replit, and n8n (all resources I was not using before). More specifically, I have been learning and practicing the importance of multiple iteration and cross checking information and sources. For example, I use real financial data from companies and cross checking calculation by doing the calculations themselves."
my mindset on AI has improved as i now see how strong of a tool it is in which it can assist us on a daily occurrence. I have learned that ai workflows have many capabilities while they are savable which means they can become a constant tool we use to make our lives easier.
"This semester, my mindset about AI in financial management transformed from seeing it as a simple calculator for definitions to understanding it as a powerful collaborative learning partner. I learned that its true value is unlocked not by asking for final answers, but by prompting it to explain the process and help build the models for complex. The most effective technique was asking the AI to generate commented Google Colab code for projects like our ""rent vs. buy"" analysis; this made abstract financial concepts tangible and interactive. Ultimately, I've realized AI isn't a shortcut to avoid work but a force multiplier that handles heavy computation, which frees me to focus on the more important skills of critical thinking and strategic decision making."
"My mindset previous to my experience in this class was very limited when it came to using AI. I only used it for basic questions and study help. I never imagined how I would be able to use it for such large analytical projects and analysis. I also have learned to be much more careful when using AI. We have learned that it has knowledge but not wisdom. One example I remember is when I used AI to help me determine how I should diversify my portfolio. It recommended different stocks with varying prices, but when I checked the prices of the stocks on Yahoo, they were completely different. I have learned how important it is to verify output from AI tools. Overall, I have learned how to use AI for long term projects rather than just utilizing it for quick results."
"Financial management has been very useful to me and will continue to be in the future. Using AI has also helped me realize that I can use AI to help with more complex longterm problems, like one of our session assignments where we considering buying vs renting. This will be helpful in the long run rather than answering a short term problem."
"This semester my mindset about AI changed. In this course we learned about the importance of AI in the workplace, for example in class we discussed about how people were laid off due to not knowing how to use AI. Although AI is useful, it is important to know how to use it. That is why we learned how to use DRIVER. By using DRIVER we are able to implement AI into our work and we are able to validate it and make sure we have reliable data. Every week we use AI and we practice using DRIVER."
"At the beginning of this semester, I didn't anticipate how much we would use AI tools in this course. I did not have much experience using AI, and I initially viewed it as a simple way to find answers, similar to a search engine. Throughout this semester, I have become much more comfortable using AI and have started understanding how to leverage it as a learning partner rather than just an answer-finder. 


One specific area of growth for me has been in writing effective prompts. In the beginning, my prompts were vague and disorganized. This led to generic responses from the AI tool that were not very helpful. Now, I've learned how to construct clearly defined prompts that allow me to use AI more like an assistant. I have found that specific prompts result in much more insightful responses. Another area of growth for me has been using AI to deepen my understanding of complex topics. When covering new material like time value of money, stock valuation, or real estate decision making, I was able to use AI to help clear up my confusion and gain knowledge in areas that I was lacking. 

The topics in this class have definitely been challenging, but I appreciate that they cover real-life situations that I will likely encounter someday. The heavy use of AI in this course has been difficult at times, but I believe it will be helpful in my future career. I am looking forward to the rest of this semester and further developing my ability to leverage AI."
"This semester changed how I think about AI in finance. At the beginning, I mostly saw AI as a fast calculator: give it numbers, get an answer. But in this class I started using it more like a partner that helps me think. I would ask AI to help me set up the problem using DRIVER: What decision are we making? What are the important inputs? Which assumptions really matter? That helped me move from ""here is the IRR"" to ""should we actually do this project and why?"" For example, in the risk and return work, AI helped me talk through base case, upside case, and downside case for two portfolios, and then make a real rule like, ""We only invest if it still beats our hurdle in base and downside."" That made me understand finance the way someone in FP&A or corporate planning would talk, not just like homework.

I also learned to ask better questions. Instead of asking AI ""what's the answer,"" I started asking, ""Which assumption is the most dangerous here?"" and ""How would I explain this to a CFO?"" AI helped me label assumptions with confidence levels (high, medium, low) and think about what happens if things go worse than expected. That made me see that in finance, the point is not just the number — the point is how you defend the number under uncertainty. At the same time, I learned AI is not perfect. If you just copy what it gives you, it might quietly assume timing or cash flow details that aren't true for the case. So now I treat AI like a junior analyst: it can organize, structure, and stress test, but I still have to check the logic. Overall, I trust AI more for thinking, but I also respect that I'm the one responsible for the final call."
"I think I've learned a ton about financial management through AI that I otherwise wouldn't have just because of how much more efficient calculations can be when trying to understand the many different topics that we have covered so far that are extremely practical after graduation. I think my mindset on AI had always been high, but even got much higher after using it throughout this course. I've learned that your prompts of what you ask of it can greatly impact the output you get from it both very positively or negatively. For example, when we did a peer activity in class within our first 2 weeks, I tested out a ""bad"" prompt while my learning partner tested out a ""good"" prompt and our output was SO different even if we were asking it to basically do the same thing about the time value of money."
"My mindset of AI has stayed the same, but I came to realize once more how AI can be used in our work to improve data and other aspects of the work. An example would be when we learned about AI relating to things like buying or renting a home and how data from AI helps homebuyers."
Stayed the same. n8n thing was cool. AI learning partner has not helped much or I havent changed the way I've used it. The coding thing in python is not the most useful but I think that it has helped learn slighlty when i really push it
"I do like this class.  I believe we are learning valuable information, however, I feel like the the ai is taking away from my learning.  It's making me more dependent on ai.  I would like to learn the skills without ai and then use ai to simplify it once I already know the information."
"This semester, using AI tools in financial management changed the way I think about learning. At first, I used AI just to check answers or get quick explanations. Over time, I realized I learn more when I use AI as a thinking partner rather than a shortcut. For example, when working through portfolio risk and return, I asked AI to explain why standard deviation matters and how correlation lowers risk, instead of just asking for the final numbers. It matters how you phrase the question."
My mindset about AI has mostly stayed the same except now I realized I can use it to automate more things rather than just an assistant or helper.  For example just using n8n for the mini project I realized this could be used for a lot more and it could help me in real life.
"This semester has completely changed my perspective on finance and artificial intelligence. Initially, I viewed AI as simply a smart calculator, but engaging with projects like the ""The hourly rate calculator"" tool and mini project 1 to build my real interactive tool has made me realize it's more like a learning partner. It doesn't just calculate numbers. it helps me question my assumptions about ""making more money,"" especially when facing time, cost, and stress and uncertain stock market situation.
I've learned that effectively using AI isn't about seeking answers, but about using it to think. for example, understanding opportunity costs and lifestyle trade-offs when analyzing the portfolio risk. When building my investment portfolio project, AI helped me understand how diversification reduces risk instead of just giving me the answer. It explained why combining Tesla and bonds smooths volatility and guided me through visualizing the efficient frontier step by step. Now, I see AI as a way to explore ideas faster and more deeply. It doesn't replace learning, but rather makes it more interactive and practical for real world examples."
My mindset for AI has stayed the same. I think it is an incredibly useful tool and as long as I am able to use it as a tool it wont take over my job. I have learned that AI needs to be prompted correctly in order to get a good response out. I learned this when applying the driver method for my session 6.
"As I said last time, this class is definitely different from any other course I have taken in the past. Because of this, it challenges me to think critically. I feel as though I get great practice on using the tools around me to get the outcome I am looking for. I am continuing to learn that AI can be a great tool, but it is not always accurate. This is why we did Mini Project 2, so we could create our own version of AI that works how we need it to. I found this project very interesting even though it was challenging. This is something I have never in my life done and is not something I see myself doing on my own in the future; this is why I am glad I was able to get this experience. Overall, the content of this course/the way we learn is very unique, but I appreciate that it shows me how to think outside the box."
"It was slightly a struggle, maybe could have gone better with a bit more help. I would like more examples of real world finance jobs using this."
"I have learned how I can utilize AI to predict stock market success through previous patterns. It has taught me a lot of things that I will continue to use with my personal portfolio, and can help me decide when to buy/sell a stock judging off of code that can be created and run in Google Colab. My mindset has changed on AI because previously I believed that AI was a tool that can help individuals complete homework and create study guides for exams and quizzes. Now I realize that AI's growth in unstoppable and it has numerous features that are extremely helpful to people in life. I used AI a few weeks ago to judge the health score of a stock that I am invested in to see whether I should sell it, keep it, or buy more of it. While it gave me a positive result on the stock I am invested in, I did not want to put more money in to it because it wasn't fully confident. AI is not strictly a tool to be used to cheat on homework or make study guides that tailor to my needs, but rather a tool that can help me judge investment opportunities, prepare for my retirement, and make many other decisions that can help me reach my personal financial goals."
"I feel like I've learned a lot in regards to how to effectively use AI to get desired outputs. Honestly, before this course, I didn't have any real guide or method to my discussions with AI. My inputs weren't defined, and looking back I can see that knowing HOW to partner with AI is really important."
"I have learned to create workflows with AI, which can be very helpful in my day-to-day life. I can now create a workflow that helps me track my expenses or estimate my investment's future value."
"I think using AI tools made me better at giving better prompts to AI and know how to get the results that I need. It is useful for providing me the concepts, the equations, and helps me understand codes and thoughts when I am stuck on a topic. It is super effective for me to learn the topics. For example, sometimes the equations in the textbook or the codes AI generated seems confusing to me, so I can ask Chat to help me understand these concepts and I get to explain them in the homework with a better idea and clear logic."
"Using AI throughout this class has taught me a lot about how it really can be beneficial in the workforce and for individuals. Instead of being more nervous to use AI, I have learned that it is a tool designed to help make workflows easier, and at the same time assist with brainstorming and thinking. 


This class is one which I like to talk about with my peers, because I think that it is important to learn about AI in higher education, especially when it will become mainstream in every workforce extremely soon. 
In regards to my learning partners, I really enjoy getting to work and collaborate with them throughout class, experimenting with different ideas and solutions to problems. My favorite activity so far was rent vs. buy, because I think it actually has real life implications for when I have to make that decision in the near future."
"I just felt AI made my life a lot easier. But sometimes I'm wondering if I learned as much as if I would to learn without AI, and the answer was most certainly no. So now i'm having mixed feelings with AI. On one hand it's a really powerful and efficient tool, but on the other hand its existence decreased me need of learning or remembering things, so I'm not sure how I feel about it. I guess the best examples was the financial equations, people I know who's enrolled in regular MGMT 310 had to remember all the formula while we only had to understand the financial concepts, not really sure at this point which ways of learning is better, or if there is a clear winner, but i do admit that the use of AI is inevitable in the near future."
"My mindset about AI has changed a lot throughout this course! I have learned how to collaborate with AI and use it as a tool rather than relying on it too much or not using it at all. It has been beneficial to learn how to use AI effectively as a learning partner - I have learned how to come up with creative and comprehensive questions to ask AI to collaborate together. I have also found the DRIVER framework to be a helpful baseline framework to solve these problems effectively. For example, I have learned how to use AI to help me define certain terms. I have also found it helpful to think outside the box of how I could apply these principles we've learned to other situations. It will be helpful for me to apply similar concepts to my own personal finance and future."
