aggar117	"When this semester started, I was using AI without a structured way to prompt it. I was simply telling it what I needed done, but was not providing the necessary context/parameters. In terms of the intersection between AI and finance, I knew that this combination existed, but I had not explored it at all. I didn't even know how to approach the concept. I think I was pretty comfortable using AI to learn, however. I had been using AI to guide my understanding in classes and having it explain concepts to me in a easy-to-understand way. What surprised me about myself this semester was how quickly I adopted the DRIVER framework into AI usage for classes outside of this class. It began to be my go-to prompting strategy and this really helped me utilize AI to its full potential this semester.ÿ
When we started adopting automated workflows into this class (project 2), that's when I felt myself grow the most. I needed to use n8n for another project in another class at the same time, so using AI and DRIVER to guide me through how to utilize n8n really helped me grow beyond my basic understanding of the content. I really enjoyed learning how to use n8n and how to apply it to both projects. I think I grew the most while working on that project since it forced me to combine my current learning process and a new learning process to finish up a complex task.ÿ
My relationship with AI has definitely leveled up from the start of the semester. I am much more confident in my ability to utilize AI when solving complex problems and in teaching myself new content. I am comfortable exploring uncertain paths now because of my newfound confidence in the use of AI to supplement my learning journey. Above all, I will carry the DRIVER framework with me for the rest of my time at Purdue and even into the workforce. This framework has truly proven to be an incredible to enhance my usage of AI and unlock a trove of possibilities I didn't know existed before this."
salharth	"When this semester started, I saw myself as someone who understood the basics of AI and finance, but mostly from a distance. I had a general idea of what AI could do, and I thought finance was mostly about numbers and formulas. I also believed that learning meant keeping up with the work and doing enough to understand the material. I didn't realize how much depth there was behind these subjects or how much my mindset would shift as the semester went on.
What surprised me most was how quickly I adapted once I allowed myself to explore the material more actively. Instead of just memorizing or following steps, I started asking better questions and looking for the deeper meaning behind every concept. I found myself enjoying the challenge rather than avoiding it. One moment that stands out was when a topic that felt completely overwhelming suddenly made sense after I broke it into smaller pieces and used a mix of textbook examples, class discussions, and AI tools to guide my thinking. That was the first time I really felt myself grow, and it changed how I approached everything afterward.Now, I see myself as a more confident and curious learner. My relationship with AI has become more collaborative because I've learned how to use it as a tool for understanding rather than a shortcut, and I'm more aware of both its strengths and its limits. I've also become more comfortable with uncertainty. Instead of seeing confusion as a sign that I'm falling behind, I see it as a natural part of learning that I can work through. Most of all, I'm walking away with a stronger belief in my ability to tackle difficult subjects by trusting the process, staying patient, and actively engaging with the material. These are skills I know I will take with me far beyond this course."
ali243	"I came in not knowing anything about ai, and i learned alot of things in this class. The thing that surprised me the most is how useful Ai is in a day to day life. I clicked when I understood that google gemeni can help you alot. I now use google gemeni for almost everyhting, I will defiantly continue to use google gemeni in the future."
ali216	"I treated finance as mostly about using a formula for a task and then getting the right answer. AI would be used as the easy way for getting answers easier.
ÿWhen I did work, I focused on the outputs. However, using driver, I started to slow down and see where I can learn the most while doing the work.
The click happened when I was using AI as a way to assist when needed and not rely. I was starting to do work because I was passionate in learning and understanding the concepts, not just for the purpose of completion.
I see AI as a learning partner and not something to rely on. I do not want my critical thinking skills to evaporate and I feel like the more AI is relied upon, we will become mind foggy.ÿ
I will carry the habit of building progress with DRIVER. I like how it makes me think deeply and learn new ideas by iteration."
nazevedo	"Before the semester started, I was unfamiliar with financial AI integration and LLMs. Additionally, although I knew about the basics of finance and how certain decisions are made within a company, I did not have direct experience applying them as I did throughout this course.ÿOne thing that surprised me was how much information I retained because of the DRIVER framework and the homework structures. I also felt the quality of assignments improve. One moment where something finally ""clicked"" was when I spent days learning and building multiple financial workflows in n8n, leading to an interest outside class. Hence, my n8n project was definitely the work I was most proud of in MGMT310.ÿBecause of the DRIVER framework, my relationship with AI is now more efficient. For instance, I'm able to verify information and prevent hallucinations while still using AI as a tool to learn and expand my knowledge.As a result, I will most likely continue increasing my expertise in AI by utilizing all the resources Purdue has to offer. AI and Automation will be a part of my professional career."
rbadam	"When this semester began, I was a rigid learner who viewed AI as a shortcut and finance as a purely black-and-white mathematical discipline, defining success by how quickly I could find the ""right"" answer. I was surprised by my initial discomfort with ambiguity, but everything finally ""clicked"" when I realized that a statistically correct model is useless without human context and judgment. I have since evolved from a passive calculator into an active interpreter of data, viewing uncertainty not as a risk to avoid, but as a variable to manage. Moving forward, I carry the understanding that my true value lies not in generating the answer, but in having the critical insight to ask the right questions."
cbakota	At the beginning of this semester I believe I was a victim to the copy and paste mindset. Not really giving my AI a chance to help me learn and comprehend.Along the way I think my understanding and different applications of AI was most surprising. I found myself using AI and more of its features for personal gain rather than just to get information from it.ÿI think the part I felt the most growth was learning how to frame your prompt and how to utilize AI to your strengths by giving the most amount of information for the AI to use. Knowing how to get the answers I wanted from the different AI assistants.ÿI think now I use AI in a much more effective and efficient way. I think I don't just copy and paste rather I pull the most important topics and prompts and give my own information to get to the answer that I need.ÿI think the main thing I will carry forward is my understanding of Organizing my prompts better and using other AI driven services to create useful applications for myself in daily living.
bansa128	"When I started the semester, I did not know much about finance or how to use AI for finance in the correct way.
What surprised me most was how well AI helped me understand the concepts which I was taught in class and how well I could connect them.ÿSomething which finally ""clicked"" for me was when I realized I was able to make the WVAs without the amount of effort I used to put in at the start of the semester. I was hesitant to talk in front of the camera at the start, but now I am very confident with the exercise.ÿ
Right now, I understand how to use AI for my benefit much better, and I can understand concepts with the help of AI, and build projects which I could have never done before.ÿ
From this experience I will use the knowledge of finance in my future classes. I will also be using the DRIVER method to my future classes as it created a very good pathway for the projects which I had in this course and helped me complete the assignments with the desired quality."
mbaratia	"When I first started this course, I wasn't knowledgeable about how to utilize AI as a tool to conduct financial analyses. In addition, I wasn't aware of the various AI workflow tools such as n8n and Replit that could be used in addition to chat bots such as Gemini, Copilot, and ChatGPT to create real world application finance tools. Throughout this course, what surprised me the most was the versatile of uses AI has in the world of finance. I felt as if I had really begun to understand how to structure my problems using the DRIVER Framework around the completion of video assignment 4.Through taking this course, I now have been able to make AI work for me instead of the other way around, helping me improve upon my initial ideas in my mini projects and provide areas feedback from AI on potential weaknesses the finance tools I had created. I believe this course provided me with useful, real world applicable AI finance skills that I will be utilizing in the future."
beebe9	"At the beginning of this semester, I thought I had a solid understanding of finance and AI. I had taken other finance classes before, so I was familiar with much of the content. However, I had never approached AI with a financial mindset, and I had never coded in my life. Using AI to learn a completely new skill was both challenging and intriguing, and I was curious to see how it could enhance my learning experience throughout the semester.
What surprised me most about myself was how quickly I adapted to coding and using DRIVER to break down complex questions. Initially, I expected a steep learning curve, but I found that I could teach myself effectively and tackle problems I had assumed would be much harder. This confidence grew as I navigated new tools and concepts, and it was encouraging to see my progress over time.One moment where everything clicked for me was during Mini Project 2 when I was using n8n. I struggled at first to understand how the website worked and how to get the tool to function correctly. After about an hour of trial and error, I finally broke the problem down and figured it out. Not only did I make the tool work, but I even improved it along the way. That ""aha"" moment solidified my understanding of how code can support financial tools and gave me a real sense of accomplishment.Now, I am much more comfortable and confident using AI to enhance my learning and even to create tools that could be useful in my personal life. Moving forward, I will carry with me the insight that AI is not just a problem-solving tool but also a way to create practical solutions that can improve efficiency and understanding."
bergeror	When the semester started I was familiar with AI but I did not know how to use it to the extent that I learned throughout the course and I knew a little bit about some Finance but I got to learn more about the concepts tying them together with the AI and learning to use the AI and it more advanced way. I was surprised how well I learned throughout the way. I really started to feel like it clicked when I was using n8nÿ as it is a very cool program and I feel like I learned a lot through it. I feel like I have a new deeper Advanced relationship with AI and learning and I will carry that forward in my experience.
lbikkavi	"Hi, my name is Lahari Bikkavilli, and I'm a junior studying Business Analytics & Information Management with a minor in Computer Science. I've always been interested in both finance and AI, but this class completely changed how I think about them, especially when they're combined. Going into the course, I thought my accounting and economics classes gave me a solid finance background, but I quickly realized there was a lot more depth to it. When it came to AI, my knowledge was pretty limited to just tools like ChatGPT.
One of the biggest takeaways for me was learning how to approach problems in a more structured way through the Driver Framework. I had heard of simple ideas like the KISS principle before, but this framework really changed how I break down and think through complex problems. I was also surprised by how much I was able to learn about building AI models myself. Using tools like n8n made the process feel way more manageable and honestly pretty fun, and it showed me that creating these kinds of systems is actually possible with the right support.
This class helped me gain a lot of confidence in my ability to learn new and technical concepts. It made me realize that with the right resources, tools, and guidance, you can figure out things that initially feel intimidating. Whether it was coding, building financial models, comparing forecasting methods, or working through complex financial calculations, these tasks felt much more achievable by the end of the course.
Overall, this course really changed how I view AI, learning, and uncertainty. I now see them as things to lean into rather than avoid. Going forward, I definitely plan to use the Driver Framework when tackling problems and continue to leverage AI as a tool to help me learn and make better decisions."
tblanton	"At the beginning of the semester, I had a good foundational knowledge of finance, but not a lot of knowledge about AI. The thing that surprised me most about myself was I actually enjoy coding and using AI in those projects. Now, I am able to use AI to enhance my learning and understanding of finance and use it improve my life. From this experience, I will carry forward the unique way of thinking and applying AI in a business setting."
wborows	"At the start of this semester, I thought I had a good understanding of AI. I believed I knew how to prompt it right to get the answers that I needed. On the finance side, I did not know much. I am not a finance major and so I did not know much of what we were going to do coming in. The thing that surprised me the most was about how to prompt AI. I though short answers would get me the same results as detailed one. I was mistaken though, learning that prompting the AI in certain ways ensure that you get a better response.ÿI finally had something click for me in about week 6. I got really into the assignment and about learning it. I learned that if I gave AI a very detailed way I wanted something done, I got something in return that I originally visualized. My Ai ability and relationship have grown exponentially. I have learned how to prompt it and use it correctly. I want to keep growing in that way and be better at using AI which is what I will carry on from this expierence."
bowma177	"When this semester started, I was very new to the world of finance and AI, with no experience in either beyond simple ChatGPT use and introductory finance courses. At the start of this semester, I assumed that finance and AI were complicated topics, and you need to be in that track in order to understand what's going on. I have found that not to be true by the end of this course.ÿ
What surprised me the most about myself this semester is my ability to take feedback and grow, ensuring I understand what I am doing wrong and work through it.ÿ
I think the moment something clicked was when I understood that talking to AI is more than just a simple conversation; it is handcrafting detailed, tailored prompts so AI fully understands the requests you are sending it. This is super important for getting an accurate, high-quality output.Now, towards the end of this course, I am very well-versed in AI prompting and connecting AI with finance. Additionally, having the understanding that the first iteration is not the last, ensuring you are checking and working with the AI is essential to get a correct outputI will carry forward a hard work ethic and the ability to move forward even if the grade is lower then expected, moving and working forward is one of the most important things I have learned"
bradfo27	"When this semester began, I saw AI as a helpful shortcut and finance as something that followed a strict set of formulas and rules. I felt comfortable memorizing concepts, completing assignments, and getting to the right answer, but I did not fully understand how learning could be iterative or how AI could be used as a thinking partner rather than a tool that simply gives outputs. I believed I understood financial management, but I mostly understood it at a surface level.
What surprised me most was how much my mindset changed. I realized that my growth did not come from immediately knowing the right answer, but from working through uncertainty and refining my thinking over time. There were moments when I felt frustrated or stuck, but those moments forced me to slow down, ask better questions, and use AI to explore ideas rather than avoid the hard parts. I also surprised myself by becoming more confident in explaining financial concepts in my own words instead of relying on definitions or formulas.
One moment where things truly clicked was when I began using the DRIVER process as a loop rather than a checklist. Instead of seeing mistakes as failures, I started seeing them as signals that I needed to revisit my assumptions. That shift helped me understand finance more deeply and made learning feel more intentional and controlled.Now, I see myself as a more independent and adaptable learner. My relationship with AI has changed from dependence to collaboration, and my comfort with uncertainty has grown. I am more willing to test ideas, revise my thinking, and trust the learning process. What I will carry forward is the confidence to approach complex problems with curiosity, structure, and patience. Learning how to DRIVE with AI has not just helped me in this class; it has changed how I will approach challenges well beyond it."
ebrumme	"1)When this semester started, I have no idea what finance really was. I thought I understood basic contents until we really started to dive into the content. My learning capabilities were pretty surface level until I started to use the DRIVER framework.ÿ
2)I was surprised by how helpful AI can be at explaining topics. I had always heard it was very unreliable but after using it I now know how to double check my work and ensure that I am getting a correct outcome.ÿ
3) I think everything started clicking about halfway through the semester. I started doing bad on the assignments and tried to push myself to embrace the DRIVER framework instead of just going through the motions. This really helped me succeed in the course.ÿ
4)My relationship with AI has changed greatly. I now understand that it is a smart tool but not intelligent. Now that I have the background, I know the best prompts to get the outcomes that I want from AI.ÿ5) I will carry forward the DRIVER framework. It really deepened my purpose of learning. I started to get curious about why things were happening instead of just moving on from the subject. I am very thankful that this course has taught me many tools that I will continue to use throughout my educational and future career."
cbrunton	"Who was I when this semester started? What did I think I knew about AI, finance, and learning?
When the semester began, I thought I had a decent grasp of finance?mostly formulas, textbook logic, and surface-level intuition?but I quickly realized that what I knew was fragmented. AI, to me, was just a productivity tool, not something that could meaningfully shape how I think or learn. I approached financial problems like isolated exercises instead of stories that needed structure. Learning itself felt linear: read, memorize, solve. I didn't yet understand what it meant to build, validate, and evolve my thinking in a deliberate way using frameworks like DRIVER.


What surprised me most about myself along the way?I was surprised by how quickly I adapted to building things?even when I didn't feel ready. Normally I hesitate before starting something unfamiliar, but the loop-based building style in the course pushed me forward and showed me I could learn by doing rather than waiting to ""feel prepared."" I also surprised myself with how much clarity I gained from explaining concepts out loud in my videos; teaching the material actually made it click. And I didn't expect to enjoy the mix of finance and AI as much as I did?it ended up feeling empowering rather than intimidating


What was one moment where something finally clicked?where I felt myself grow?A major turning point was when TVM problems shifted from being formulas to being timelines?when I understood that every financial decision is just cash flows moving through time. That ""aha"" moment made stocks, bonds, mortgages, and even corporate projects feel like variations of the same idea. Another moment was recognizing how validation works: not just checking math, but developing financial skepticism and testing assumptions. Suddenly, finance felt less like guessing numbers and more like telling a defendable story using structured reasoning. That mindset shift made me feel like I was actually thinking like an analyst


Who am I now? How has my relationship with AI, learning, and uncertainty changed?
Now, I see myself as someone who can build things, explain things, and reason through uncertainty instead of freezing in it. I use AI more intentionally?not to give me answers, but to challenge my logic, help me validate ideas, or refine my thinking. Learning no longer feels like passively absorbing information; it feels like iterating, testing, and improving. And uncertainty feels less threatening because I have a framework to navigate it?DRIVER gave me a way to break big problems into steps I can handle.


What will I carry forward from this experience?
I'll carry forward the belief that progress starts with a rough draft?whether it's code, a model, or a financial analysis. I'll bring the habit of validating my assumptions rather than trusting the first answer that looks correct. I'll take the confidence that I can combine finance and technology to create something real, not just solve homework problems. Most importantly, I'll keep the mindset that learning is something I actively shape, not something that happens to me."
buchei	At the start of the semester I was someone very skeptical of taking a course so integrated with AI. I knew very little about to effectively use AI to create something powerful. During this course it allowed me to learn about the functions of AI. I was able to learn much more with AI.ÿThings started to click for me fairly early. After a couple of weeks I started to understand how AI functions and how to get what I want from it. I stopped asking it as vague of prompts and tried to make it dive deeper. This allowed me to grow in this course and become better at it. I will carry forward a deeper understanding of AI and Finance by taking this course.
rcairo	"When this semester started, I had little knowledge of AI aside from knowing it was helpful in some capacity. My learning methods were outdated (not really using AI to help speed up the learning process). I had not known much about financial management at the time. I was surprised when I realized that training AI models through the use of DRIVER was not too complicated and extremely helpful in getting better answers. I realized that AI had grown on me over the past semester. I remember a time when ChatGPT would get simple algebraic answers wrong! A moment when something clicked was when studying for another class, I had used the DRIVER method to set up a study guide for said class, and ended up saving a lot of time in the long run. I now use AI a lot more than I did at the beginning of the semester, as it's a tool that will only continuously improve throughout my lifetime. I now use AI as a fast, compact tutor that allows me to learn an entire unit in half the time, thus allowing for greater intellectual growth. From now on, I will continue to use AI to learn, study, and reinforce information taught to me in class and in further life when I land a job after graduation."
carro146	"Before this class, I was very uneducated on how much an AI output could very depending on the inserted prompt. I would normally enter a very undetailed and vague prompt and be confused why I recieved an inaccurate and undetailed output. Before this class I also thought that AI was a lot smarter when it came to outputting the correct financial values for given questions when in reality, it was quite inaccurate.ÿ
What surprised me the most throughout this course was how much more accurate my AI outputs have gotten. Now, in all of my future courses, I will be able to gain a much better understanding of the classes data due to being able to recieve more accurate data from AI (when allowed).ÿ
During the beginning of the semester, I was very lost and confused as to why we were doing those assignments and mini projects because I assumed that since we were all putting it into AI, that we would all get the same results. Everything finally clicked, though, during mini project 3 because I finally understood n8n and how to use AI to create precise coding to create the model. Seeing my grades reflect my hard work through this class helped prove that I was doing it correctly.ÿ
I am now confident on answering complex problems and knowing that if I write a detailed prompt, that I will recieve more accurate answers. Looking at some finance problems, it can be frightening and they definitely create uncertainties on if you are doing the problems correctly, but after a lot of practice I am a lot more confident on pretty much all of the topics and problems we have done this far.ÿFrom this experience, I will carry forward my ability to answer complex problems and have better knowledge on creating a great AI prompt. Now I know the difference that a good prompt makes when trying to recieve a good output. I will also carry on my ability to work as a team to get to the correct answers without AI. Having my classmates to work through the problems with helped ensure that we were all on the same page and also helped combine all of our thoughts to become more educated on the subject."
case47	"When I started this semester, I was lost when it came to AI and didn't really understand the best ways to use it to advance my learning. I figured finance was just about crunching numbers and that ""learning"" meant staring at a textbook until it stuck. The biggest surprise for me was actually realizing that I could get comfortable with this tech way faster than I expected once I actually got to use AI myself in our projects.ÿThe real turning point was during Mini Project 2 when we used n8n. Seeing that workflow come together was the moment everything clicked and I saw it wasn't just theory anymore, but a real tool I could use to automate things and actually get stuff done. Now, I feel way more capable and less scared of breaking things or not knowing the answer right away. My relationship with learning has definitely shifted from ""memorize this"" to ""figure out how to solve this,"" and I actually see AI as a partner in that process now. I'm taking away the confidence that even if I don't know something yet, I have the tools and DRIVER philosophy to help me."
jcasian	"One day in October, during the daily calls I have with my parents, I discussed them about AI. How it was advancing and they ways I was learning to use it. They shared their stories, specially some funny interactions they had heard of others while using it. Long story short, my parents and I agreed on how necessary was actually knowing the correct usage of AI.ÿ
Before this class, I had used AI, but not in a way that I could benefit a lot form it. Now, after the past 16 weeks, I have understood how to manage AI in order to generate the results I want.ÿ
After using it to understand the finance topics we discussed at the beginning, it clicked when I realize those were the same terms I was learning at my accounting class. AI helped with this class, unintentionally with other classes, and I intentionally made AI help me with a lot of other things.ÿI plan to keep using AI but in a smart way."
cheng754	"I think my take wash for this class is really the DRIVE analysis, I learned to approach each case and situation with an organized mindset. This helped me a lot through solving each assignment, working with peers during class has also taught me how to communicate my thoughts and deliver it to another person."
colon34	"When the semester started, I didn't know much about AI. I though AI was just something my peers had been using to do their homework for them. I never really experimented with AI because I did not want to become reliant on it and never think for myself. As for finance, I didn't know much. I didn't know what fiance really entailed other than money and math. Lastly, I though that learning was done mainly through typical lectures and then tests.
What suprised me most about myself along the way was how willing I was to take a deep dive and learn the content to do the video assignments well. I am also surprised I was able to learn AI and how to use it as an efficient tool. I have now integrated AI into my life to help me, not to think for me. One thing about finance that suprised me is how much uncertainty there is and that it is basically a lot of forecasting and estimated guessing.ÿ
I think the repetition of doing the video assignments and making sure I understood the fiance topics in order to teach them helped me grow. I was able to get better at taking a topic we learned in class and expanding on it. I think around session 10 was when I really got the hang of leveraging AI to help me learn the finance topics and use it as a tool to run calculations and create graphs.ÿMy relationship with AI is much stronger and more positive. I now understand just how powerful of a tool it can be. I am now ask myself, ""can this be done more efficiently with AI"" and if the answer is yes then I should be using it. After doing the video assignments I am not scare to jump into researching a topic I don't have a lot of knowledge about. All it takes is a little bit of reading, research and video watching.ÿ
From this experience, I will carry forward my new knowledge on how to use AI as a tool. I also will carry forward the DRIVER framework to use of issues that I may feel like are too big to tackle. Using the Driver framework to take a step back and go through the problem in steps, is very helpful for solving, what feels like, big problems."
icorrale	"When the semester started, I had some background in finance from courses like accounting, which introduced me to certain finance terms. However, I knew very little about AI and how to navigate it. I'm not very tech-savvy so I definitely didn't know I could create an app using AI.
I was most surprised by how quickly I was able to learn to work with AI. I didn't expect to use it in finance or to navigate it effectively to get exactly the results I wanted.
After a few tries using the DRIVER method, it finally clicked for me. I realized what I was really looking for and how to fit all the letters into the method. That moment made me feel like I truly understood the process.
I now feel much more confident working with AI. I understand how to navigate it to get the outcomes I want and I even know how to make an app if I ever need to again. I'm also more open to trying new tools and methods and figuring things out even when I start with little knowledge.
I will carry forward my improved understanding of finance and AI and AI's applications in finance, as well as the skills I developed in learning new tools like google collab and methods like DRIVER."
vcraw	"I didn't really know anything about finance until this semester truly. I feel like I was finally able to grasp at least a little bit of insight into the widely diverse field of finance. I am happy to have been able to learn in this way and incorporate AI into my projects in order to assist with my thoughts. I was surprised at how much I could actually accomplish. Before this I didn't know how to use AI near to the extent of what I do now and I think that gives me a huge advantage in the coming years. I think AI is a great tool and I appreciated when you had to say that AI is not smart it is just doing its job, we are the ones who have to think and process the outputs ai gives us. I will carry forward my perseverance of learning new skills that are tough to understand but I will continue to push towards my goals. Thank you for a great semester."
creanc	"At the start of this semester I used Ai purely to do some of my ""busy"" work for me and to do the things I was too lazy to do. But after this whole semester with Ai I have realized that Ai can help me learn and I can actually grow with Ai. It is a tool that when used right, can further my learning and I can treat Ai as a partner to help me discover new things. I can confidently say that I will be using Ai as an asset going forward in my studies and in my professional career. This class was great for me to have experience in using Ai in the finance world, to help me learn and gain experience through all of the projects."
cruz22	"Hello Professor, before beginning this class, I did not know much about finance but I did have a little experience with AI- Gemini and chatgpt. What surprised me about myself along the way was the ability to adapt to the DRIVER foundation, which I fully understand now. We can take it as a principle to apply in life and in various projects we want to undertake, not just as an acronym. The way I learned it and what surprised me was once I realized that AI is meant to be the passenger- we are the drivers! This is the one thing that, once it ""clicked"" for me, was very obvious what I needed to do. Now, what I want to takeaway from this class is the financial knowledge learned. I'll be honest Professor, there are still a few concepts I don't fully understand, which is why I haven't turned in two assignments. But, what I really liked most about the class was the bonds session. So, what I want to invest in are bonds and small index funds with the help of AI to gather all the bits and pieces, and take the final decision. Most of all with AI going forward, I will be the driver and not the passenger. Thank you for the semester."
rdate	"When this semester started I was very inexperienced with AI and I quite frankly didn't know what to expect with this course. What surprised me the most along the way was my ability to problem solve with the help of AI. There were a lot of times where I was stuck and used AI to help me get out of the jam. A moment where everything seemed to ""click"" for me was the first mini project where we finally applied our AI and financial knowledge to a financial application. I am now much more well versed in the applications of AI in the finance world and I am comfortable using AI to help me work through complex financial problems. I will carry forward my newfound AI knowledge to the professional world to give me the upper hand on my peers."
dave59	"When this semester began, I was a student new to finance and technology who felt apprehensive about the course structure, assuming that learning finance was simply about how to read and interpret financial statements.ÿrather than active modeling. I was surprised to discover that purpose over polish mattered more than perfectionÿ, and that I could gain genuine confidence in applying AI tools to real-world challenges. The moment everything clicked was when I fully embraced theÿDRIVER Framework (Define, Represent, Implement, Validate, Evolve, Reflect) , allowing finance, AI, and problem-solving to come together in a practical way. Now, I see myself as a DRIVER in the AI Era.ÿand a capable decision-maker. Who treats AI as a collaborator to accelerate learning while ensuring that the final mastery remains human. I will carry forward the DRIVER mindset and the ability to make financial thinking visible, ensuring I can communicate mastery on video and defend my choices in any future role."
david54	"When this semester started, I was a finance student who viewed Python as an intimidating barrier and finance as a collection of rigid textbook formulas. I thought I understood markets to buy low, sell high, and I viewed AI primarily as a shortcut to get answers rather than a tool for deep analysis. My approach to learning was passive; I expected to simply memorize rules and apply them.What surprised me most was discovering how much ""storytelling"" exists in the numbers. I realized that coding isn't just about syntax or fixing errors, it is about translating a strategic narrative into a testable hypothesis. I was also surprised by my own ability to grasp the logic of programming once I connected it to the financial concepts.The moment everything finally ""clicked"" arrived when I truly grasped the concept of the Cost of Capital. For weeks, I treated it as just another variable to plug into a formula. But while running a sensitivity analysis, I suddenly understood that equity isn't ""free"" money just because there are no interest payments. I realized that every dollar a company holds has an opportunity cost attached to it?the return investors expect for the risk they are taking. Seeing how a slight shift in that cost could turn a ""profitable"" project into a value-destroying one bridged the gap between academic theory and real-world decision-making.Now, I am an analyst who views uncertainty not as a roadblock, but as a variable to be modeled. My relationship with AI has shifted from reliance to partnership. I use it to structure my thinking and stress-test my assumptions rather than just asking for the answer. I will carry forward the DRIVER framework specifically the lesson that you must rigorouslyÿDefine the problem and Validate your risks before you ever spend a dollar of capital."
dedhiaj	"When the semester began, I saw AI as something interesting, but largely as a tool to acquire quick answers. Finance felt separate?something you learnt through lectures, formulae, and examples, not something directly related to AI. I also assumed that learning was primarily about finishing projects, rather than using tools to examine and challenge my own thinking.Over time, I learned how to correctly use AI?not as a shortcut, but as a means of gaining a deeper understanding of finance. I observed how well AI and finance can work together, from breaking down concepts to discovering new financial aspects and opportunities. A major ""click"" moment for me was applying AI on a real-world project outside of class, such as Mini Golf India, where I utilized it to brainstorm pricing and basic planning. That made everything feel more real and demonstrated how these skills can be applied in the future.Now, I view AI as an integral part of my future, rather than a supplementary tool. I know there is still a lot to learn about what AI can accomplish, particularly in finance, and this inspires me to keep learning. I'm particularly pleased for how well Dr.Zhang taught this course?he explained everything clearly, tied AI and finance together in a practical way, and made the information seem relevant. I'm pleased about the prospect of working with him again in the future."
dejesus3	"1. Who were you when this semester started? What did you know (or think you knew) about AI, finance, and learning itself?When the semester started, I honestly didn't know much about AI beyond asking it simple questions. I didn't think of it as something you could actually build tools with or use to break down financial decisions. My understanding of finance was pretty basic too?just the simple ideas like interest, returns, or risk. I definitely didn't expect a class to combine finance with AI in a way where I had to think, design, test, and learn through an actual process.
2. What surprised you most about yourself along the way?I was surprised by how fast I got comfortable using AI as part of my workflow. At first, I felt unsure about what to type or how to even start a project. But as the assignments got harder, I learned I could understand more than I expected. I also surprised myself by becoming more organized with how I approached each DRIVER step instead of just guessing or rushing.3. What's one moment where something finally ""clicked"" ? where you felt yourself grow?The big moment for me was Mini-Project 3 when I built the advanced AI finance tool. Seeing my own workflow run, with nodes and logic that I set up, made everything from earlier in the semester make sense?WACC, CAPM, cash flows, risk, and discount rates. It was the first time I felt like I had actually created something real, not just completed an assignment.4. Who are you now? How has your relationship with AI, with learning, with uncertainty changed?Now I feel a lot more confident in both finance concepts and using AI. I'm more comfortable experimenting, trying things, and learning through the process instead of worrying about being wrong. My relationship with AI changed from ""I guess I can ask it questions"" to ""I can use this to think better and build things."" I'm not as intimidated by complicated ideas because I know how to break them down.5. What will you carry forward from this experience?What I'll carry forward is the mindset of using AI as a tool, not a shortcut. The DRIVER framework taught me how to define problems, test ideas, revise them, and improve them. I can use that approach in my construction management classes, in finance, and in my future career. This class didn't just teach me formulas?it changed the way I approach learning and problem-solving."
dillinga	"I can without a doubt say that this class taught me so much more about how to leverage AI and use it as a tool professionally and for life.ÿ
What surprised me most was my capacity to learn this material in such as fast past thanks to the help of AI. I felt like I was collecting tons of calculations over a short time.ÿ
I think when I did the first project and I started working on the DRIVER framework and starting of with defining what I know and then discovering new information with AI I realized that wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be when I can learn as I do the project and understand the calculations even deeper when implementing them into python rather than just writing them out and doing them by hand.ÿ
Pushing myself to learn how to prompt and make AI part of the learning process has been really beneficial and I feel confident in my able to use it in the future and less fearful of it's impact on the job market and professional world. I started off not using AI to it's full capacity, but now I can really get AI to become my learning partner.
What I will carry forward is the DRIVER framework, after doing so many projects that involved this mindset and structure, it will be hard to forget the steps and I know it will end up following it on my future projects. I think so often in projects people jump into the implementation stage without really thinking through what they are doing and this causes people to have to do way too many iterations when they could start off with defining and discovering and creating a map of their strategies rather than just redoing calculations over and over."
rdinn	"When this semester started, I felt like I had a decent handle on stats, probability, and the basics of finance, but I didn't really see AI as anything more than a tool you use here and there. I thought learning was supposed to look a certain way?follow the steps, get the formula right, move on. I was confident, but honestly a little boxed in by how I thought things ""should"" be done.
What ended up surprising me the most was how much more open I became to uncertainty. I started asking more questions, not just to get answers but to understand the reasoning behind everything. I got more comfortable trying things out, being wrong, and then figuring out why. It stopped feeling like I needed everything to be perfect before I could move forward.
One moment that really clicked for me was during a probability assignment where I was stuck on a joint distribution problem for way too long. I finally stepped back, visualized how the conditional densities behaved, and it all came together?the expectations, the marginals, the independence check. For the first time it felt like I wasn't just doing math; I actually understood what the math was saying. That feeling of things lining up in my head made me realize I was growing.Now, I'm a lot more flexible in how I approach learning. I see AI differently too?not as something that replaces thinking, but something that pushes me to think better. I'm way more willing to explore, to ask ""why,"" to try different angles instead of rushing to the final answer. I've gotten more patient with myself, and honestly more curious.What I'll carry forward from this is that mindset: being willing to explore the messy parts, to ask questions, to use the tools around me in a way that actually deepens my understanding. It's not just about knowing financial concepts?it's about becoming someone who can navigate uncertainty and figure things out. That's the part that'll stick with me."
dodson22	"When this semester began, I approached finance, AI, and learning with a foundational yet arguably rigid perspective. I viewed finance primarily as a set of mechanical formulas?an objective, fixed discipline where the goal was to input numbers and output a single, correct answer. My understanding of AI was limited to its function as a powerful search engine or calculator, an external tool to offload tedious work. As a learner, I focused heavily on rote memorization and the technical accuracy of individual steps, believing that mastering the parts automatically meant mastering the whole. I was comfortable with certainty and uncomfortable with the ambiguity inherent in real-world investment decisions.Along this journey, what surprised me most was my evolving capacity for synthesis and strategic judgment. I realized that my most valuable contribution isn't performing the calculation but rather framing the question and validating the assumptions. For instance, learning about the crucial role of Terminal Value ?the single largest driver of most valuations?forced me to confront uncertainty head-on. My initial impulse was to seek the ""perfect"" discount rate or growth rate, but I was surprised to find myself developing a comfort with ranges and scenario planning, recognizing that the process of justifying the range is more important than the point estimate itself.The moment something finally ""clicked"" was during the comprehensive business valuation assignment, synthesizing all the course material. It wasn't about correctly calculating the Free Cash Flow (FCF) or the WACC, but about integrating the three financial statements into a coherent narrative. The model had to balance mechanically (assets = liabilities + equity) while also telling a sensible business story (e.g., how the revenue growth rate must logically drive capital expenditures and working capital changes). When I successfully linked the operating drivers on the income statement through the balance sheet to produce a single, defensible Enterprise Value, I felt a shift: I was no longer an executor of formulas, but a financial architect.
Who I am now is fundamentally different. My relationship with AI has evolved from viewing it as a mere tool to seeing it as a collaborative partner?an AI co-pilot that enhances my analytical speed and checks for blind spots, allowing me to focus on high-level strategic thinking and scenario analysis. My relationship with learning has broadened from technical accuracy to analytical judgment and communication. And most importantly, my stance on uncertainty has changed from fear to acceptance; I now understand that ambiguity is not a failure of the model, but the core challenge of finance that requires triangulation and a robust valuation philosophy. What I will carry forward is the DRIVER framework?the systematic approach to defining, modeling, validating, and reflecting on complex problems?recognizing that the ultimate value in finance lies in the critical thinking used to assess risk and make disciplined decisions."
jdragoni	"Going into this class, I did not think that it was going to be set up the way it was, as I had heard different things about this course from friends who had taken it before. But, after going through these past 16 weeks, I have to say that I am happy I got the exposure to AI that I did through this course.ÿ
When the semester started, I used AI as a way to assist with assignments, get quick answers to questions, not really thinking extremely deep into the prompts that I was feeding into the LLM, and certainly not thinking about the DRIVER framework with AI. I thought more so that learning with AI meant getting help when I was confused about concepts, and not necessarily having it drive my learning experience, especially with finance. I did not think that I'd be using AI so much to learn about finance, and I think the hands-on work with DRIVER definitely prepared me more for a finance career if I so choose to go into that, since I think AI will have a large role there.ÿ
I was most surprised at how much better I have gotten at giving LLMs prompts to help me to get answers. I have moved away from single line prompts and feel like I am much better at giving AI more detailed prompts to get better answers. Having an actual framework to use to think through problems like this helps a lot. I was also surprised about how easy it was to build apps, as evidenced with the mini-projects we did. I enjoyed doing those since it felt like anybody can make software without knowing how to code.ÿA moment where it felt like something clicked for me was, again, working with the mini-projects in this class. I felt like with those projects, I could actually build something useful for certain finance tasks, and that they felt like something high level that would've taken many weeks to make and lots of coding experience. But, being able to build these projects with AI assistance definitely gave me more confidence when working with AI.ÿI would say that I am much more confident working with AI and being able to derive more ""out of the box"" answers to finance cases like the session assignments using the DRIVER framework and what I have learned in this class. I think that having a professor that really encourages the use of AI makes me closer with AI and that I feel like I am using it for more things in my life, which can be a good and a bad thing. But, AI has definitely helped with my learning and the prompts I give to AI to get better answers and boost my learning.ÿ
What I will carry with me from this experience is the DRIVER framework. I think that this methodology could help me with many other classes and assignments, and using AI this way will help me to do better work and have a different way of thinking. I also think that I will have more knowledge about finance concepts from the way this class was taught as well, which is important especially if I want to work in the finance industry in the future.ÿThanks for a great semester!"
debadi	"I thought of AI as a negative tool, and believed it should not be used as a shortcut to learning. However, taking this course taught me to use it as a tool and not let it drive me, and to find educated assumptions using AI as a service to me.
I was surprised by how easy it is to navigate AI and use it to drive my assumptions, and sometimes it can help me bypass upper-division coding courses.ÿ
I would definitely say our first mini project in which we built a tool with AI that can actually be applicable in the real world. It gave me a benchmark of how I have progressed and my application of AI to finance.ÿ
I will most definitely be using AI when needed to help drive my thinking, as it can be a very effective tool upon correct use. It's important to be the one driving AI, because if you sit in the backseat metaphorically (and let AI drive you), you become obsolete.
I will most likely be using AI for modeling purposes in addition to my skills in excel. It is very effective for multi-layer cells and different embedded equations."
echevem	"At the beginning of the semester, I was a very inexperienced AI user. I mostly used it to study, help with assignments, or ask questions when I didn't know something. I didn't really understand how to use it strategically or what its limits were.
What surprised me most was how much my understanding of AI improved. I learned not only what AI can do for me, but also what it cannot do, which helped me use it more effectively and intentionally.
I felt myself grow as I kept submitting video assignments and getting more comfortable with the class. Things really clicked when I finally understood the DRIVER method and how it could guide my thinking and problem-solving process.
Now, I feel like a much more experienced AI user. I know how to ask the right questions and how to use AI for more advanced tasks, like building apps or working through finance models, instead of just getting quick answers.What I will carry forward from this class is both the experience with AI and the DRIVER method. I know these tools will be useful in my future work and help me approach problems more confidently and effectively."
seichsta	"Before the beginning of this semester I had heard every single professor talk badly about AI. None of my professors believed that AI could be used as a tool, and that it was only used to cheat. I myself knew that AI could be used in many impressive ways in Finance. During my past Finance internships AI had been a great tool in helping come up with things like excel formulas, to helping me learn how to calculate specific metrics. The thing that surprised me the most is how achievable AI makes things for the typical Finance student. After this class, I look at AI totally different. I now know that I can use AI to help me code apps, financial tools, and detailed analyses. I will genuinely always remember this class and will take all of the DRIVER tools that I have learned in this class and apply it everywhere I go in my professional career.Thank you for an amazing semester Dr. Zhang!-Sam"
neldi	"As I leave this semester, I carry forward more than just financial ratios. I am taking with me the ability to [key takeaway, e.g., question assumptions / leverage technology without relying on it blindly]. I learned how to DRIVE with AI, which means I am ready to step into a future where human insight and machine efficiency work together. This experience has proven to me that I am capable of [final empowering statement].ÿ


ÿ


Here is the revised version. I have removed theÿemÿdashes, smoothed out the punctuation, and balanced the tone so the transition from the beginning (casual) to the end (reflective) feels natural.ÿ


ÿ


So, at the start of this semester, aboutÿ16 weeksÿago, I showed up with only what I had managed to teach myself. Iÿhadn'tÿever taken an official class in Finance or AI, so honestly, I just knew some basics. I always thought of those subjects as twoÿtotally differentÿthings, and Iÿwasn'tÿsure how they wouldÿmix togetherÿin a classroom. I came in knowing I had a lot to pick up and feeling a little overwhelmed.ÿ


The thing that really caught me off guard was how fast I managed to get up to speed with the technical side of things. I seriously had zero experience with Python, butÿsomehowÿI ended up using Gemini and Google Colab toÿactually writeÿcode. That totally changed the game for me. Suddenly, I could look at financial info in ways I never could before.ÿAt first, I thought I would just be typing questions for the AI, but in our mini-projects, I went from basic prompts to actually building little apps.ÿGoing from just using the tools to making stuff myself gave me a major boost in confidence.ÿ

The moment everything finally ""clicked"" was when I realized why this course was designed this way. It became clear that we are at a crossroads where we either learn to use these tools or we get left behind. I saw the real-world applications of how this technology makes processing information faster and more accessible. However, the most important lessonÿwasn'tÿjust about speed. It was about vigilance. I realized that while AI is powerful, it requires a human ""driver"" to catch the mistakes, logical errors, andÿcalculationÿfaults that the model inevitably makes.ÿ


Today, my relationship with AI has fundamentally changed. I have moved from basic familiarity to a genuine understanding of how to make the technology work for me. I now know how to guide the AI to help me solve complex problems rather than just hoping for a right answer. I am carrying forward the knowledge that AI is a powerful engine, but I must remain the pilot. I know I need to be always ready to verify the output and adapt to the uncertainty of a rapidly changing landscape."
aemenhi	"When I first came into this class I had a very negative perception of AI and I still have a lot of the same issues with it now that I did when I first came into the class. I think that AI especially in school settings, like an AI finance class is an easy way to get out of learning. Obviously, that's not the goal but people will always find the easiest path to getting work done, and AI has virtually paved that path. With that being said, this class has allowed me to appreciate the practicality of AI.No matter how much I may dislike it, the world is going to be continuing to rely more and more on AI in the near future. Having exposure to it in this sense has allowed me to be more confident with my competence of AI coming into the workforce. What surprised me most was how much AI is able to do and it'll be interesting to see how it shapes the future. But, with that being said, I don't think AI should replace learning and with the innate laziness of human nature, there is a good chance it could. Therefore a fine line must be walked between teaching and leaning."
eenav	"1.I thought I had a solid understanding of AI and how it worked, I've used it a lot as a teacher for when I am doing homework assignments. I find it is a very good teacher and can explain things well when a teacher isn't present. I did not know a lot about finance and how the time value of money works.ÿ2. What surprised me most about myself along the way was how much better I was getting at using AI to help me with problems. I learned that their is a right way to talk to AI and that basically comes down to being very specific with what you want.3. I'm not sure exactly when this was, probably some time in lecture earlier in the semester but the concept of TVM just started making sense one day and I could see how it can be applied to any problem now.ÿ4. I think I am more specific with what I want when I talk to AI now and this helps narrow down the information I am trying to get because AI will give you an overload of information if you aren't specific.ÿ5. I will continue to use AI to help me learn during homework assignments and I will carry forward the language I learned to use while talking to AI."
bmengels	"When this semester first started, I had gained some prior experience and an introduction to financial management using AI as a tool in another course. I knew there were things I was comfortable performing using AI as a tool, however, I knew I still had much more to learn as I sat through that first week of class. Before this semester, I knew I had a confident grasp on Real Estate & Mortgages with my background being in the residential field. What I didn't know as much, was how AI is truly able to enhance one's learning ability in reference to Financial Management!
As the semester progressed, I began to see myself growing and learning how I could use AI as a tool to help solve financial management scenarios! I actually was quite surprised on how quickly I was able to solve complex financial problems through the use of AI, versus trying to solve that same problem on my own. In other words, using AI as a tool not only helped me solve the original scenario, but it also taught me how to solve future similar scenarios on my own!Now, I was proud of myself after about halfway through our semester. It was around the time we were learning about CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model), and I was reading about one of the topic scenarios. I had never known of or applied CAPM in a real world scenario until that week where I ended up talking to one of my family members about during our evening dinner! It was a great feeling to talk about something I'd just recently learned, especially since it happened to be on the topic of CAPM. This was just one moment throughout this semester where it felt like something ""clicked"".Now that this semester has come to an end, I can confidently say that my relationship with AI and ability to use it as a tool has grown significantly. I've learned I have resources out there such as AI, that can assist me in solving real world financial management problems, and that I shouldn't take for granted. Moving forward past this semester, I will proudly take the knowledge and learning I've gained throughout these past 16 weeks. It's been amazing to not only see myself grow in learning financial management, but also my peers around me. If there's one thing I'll be carrying forward past this semester, it's to always use AI as a tool, not just as a source for answers. One has to learn how to work with AI, not just letting AI do all the heavy lifting. Thank you for a great semester!"
evans596	"When this semester started, I honestly didn't know how to use AI. I wasn't sure how it worked or how to fit it into my actual work. But as I got into the coursework, I surprised myself. I didn't just get through the material; I picked it up quickly and really enjoyed the process.ÿ ÿ ÿThe big turning point was the first mini-project. That was the moment everything finally ""clicked."" Actually using the tools to solve a problem helped me learn much more than just listening to lectures. Now, I view AI differently. It isn't just a shortcut; it is a partner that helps me perfect my craft. I will carry forward the simple fact that AI helps very, very much, allowing me to do my best work with confidence."
ffacente	"When I started Mgmt 310, I came in with a pretty basic toolkit. My financial knowledge was limited to what I had picked up in high school classes, and while I had used chatbots before, I treated AI like a simple search engine. I thought I knew how these tools worked, but I didn't realize that I was essentially using a calculator to do basic addition. I viewed learning finance as memorizing definitions rather than learning how to leverage technology to solve actual problems.
The biggest surprise along the way was discovering that the AI is only as smart as the person asking the questions. I realized quickly that the specific phrasing of a prompt completely dictates the quality of the result; lazy questions got me lazy answers. This lesson in precision actually helped when we got to the Time Value of Money (TVM). That was the moment everything clicked. I realized that TVM wasn't just another chapter, but the anchor for everything else we were learning. Seeing that pattern made finance feel less like a list of rules and more like a logical system.Now, I view uncertainty differently. Instead of panicking when I don't know an answer, I feel confident using AI to help break down the problem. As I look toward graduate school or a potential career in finance, I'm taking with me a solid grasp of core concepts like TVM, but more importantly, the skill of ""prompt engineering."" I know now that the ability to ask the right question is just as valuable as knowing the answer."
foste304	"At the beginning of the semester, I thought that I knew about finance and how AI can be used as a tool. To me, AI was a tool of efficiency, solving problems and finding quick solutions. This semester, learning felt like a long process of memorizing the different frameworks and how to apply them to assignments. I did not realize that the connection between finance and AI could be so deep.
What surprised me most about this class is that my problem-solving skills strengthened - mainly my critical thinking. Rather than using AI as a shortcut, I learned how to use it as a partner, challenging myself to find new solutions. This showed me that there are many learning opportunities out there.ÿ
One moment that clicked was then I started to apply our frameworks to real-life scenarios. In my other finance and accounting classes, I was able to relate certain topics back to this class. Because of that, I have found it much more obtainable to be good at all of these classes, since they have some common topics.ÿ
What I will carry forward is the mindset of forming my own learning journey. Although this class is financial management, the most important thing that I learned is to stay authentic while persisting through difficult assignments. This is something that I will be able to apply for the rest of my professional career.ÿThank you so much for this semester!"
franc103	"This semester in MGMT 31000 has been eye opening in many aspects. Firstly, I would say that my understanding of finance changed a lot, as I realised how while it includes doing calculations, accounts, and balance sheets in all revolves around the concept of Time Value of Money (TVM). I now understand how important that concept is when it comes to forming the backbone of finance as a whole, which lets evaluate payments and financial decisions. Not only that, but I was also able to start applying some of the learnings from class into my personal life when it came to possibly learning about stocks and evaluating them and seeing if certain investments and payment structures are worth it. Overall, I learned to see the world of finance from a different perspective and apply it to my daily life.ÿ
Furthermore, my views on using AI also changed. Prior to taking this class I was not too comfortable using AI as I believed it would take away from my creativity. However, upon utilising it in my work for this class I realised how AI is only a tool for my to use and without my understanding and creativity it cannot be of much use. Additionally, I also understood how important prompt writing could be; this is something that surprised me as with more detail and structure to my prompts I saw a clear improvement in the AI's response. Learning about such small things were the crucial points this semester as I was able to learn how to better use AI as a tool to improve my ideas and thinking and not produce them. Therefore, this class provided a great learning curve for me to see the true use of AI."
freem174	"When this semester started, I honestly didn't know what I was walking into. I understood the basic finance stuff, but I didn't feel confident actually using it. Half the time I felt like I was just guessing. I definitely didn't think I'd end up doing some of the things I can do now.One thing that surprised me was how much started to click once I stopped overthinking everything. There were a few assignments where I finally felt like, ""Okay, wait, I actually get this."" That was a big shift for me. Instead of panicking when something looked complicated, I started breaking it down and realized I could handle more than I thought.
Now, looking back, I feel way more confident than I did at the start. I'm not scared of messy problems anymore. I've learned how to slow down, figure things out, and trust myself a little more.What I'm taking with me is the fact that I reallyÿcanÿlearn things that used to feel overwhelming. And honestly, that's the biggest win from this whole class."
fu450	"At first, I only knew about putting things into ChatGPT, feeding them some info to get feedback, like in a more passive way of learning. But after this class, I feel like I know more about the AI tools. Before, I didn't even know that students can get free access to Gemini Pro, or that it can generate code. And now, I know some websites can build your app, and run your Excel sheets data, which is pretty cool.I learned that AI is not controlling humans; people only think in that way because they were passive learning users. But once you actually realize howÿ AI works, how it can help with your coding and creation, then you can truly be ""learning"" with AI."
gaddam10	"1.) At the beginning of the semester, I did not know much about AI. I did not know that it could create code to calculate complex topics such as the ones we learned about in class. In terms of finance, I did not have the tools to navigate complex financial topics and scenarios. I did not know how to make business decisions in terms of calculating PV, FV, D/E ratios and other calculations. In terms of learning, I found out a more nuanced way to learn information by integrating class information and AI.
2.) Something that surprised me most about myself was that I did not know that I would be able to create videos to break down complex financial topics. I never thought that I would be able to learn how to edit videos and stitch together a face camera recording + a screen recording together in one video. I was also surprised that I was able to run code for financial calculations since I never thought that I would be able to integrate the two topics in my time here at Purdue.
3.) I felt myself grow when I became quicker at each session assignment. I had created a process for completing each assignment which made my work more efficient and accurate. It clicked when I was able to learn how the code worked, which made my explanations more complex. I also learned about Google Colab which was useful in both this class as well as my other classes. I learned about Replit and n8n which helped me learn how to implement AI in new ways.
4.) I am now able to utilize AI and given inputs to create a well-rounded video explaning financial concepts. I know how to properly edit and upload videos as well. I learned how to create videos in advance so I would have time to make corrections and submit it accurately. Overall, I was able to grow my skills as a student by learning how to use different applications.5.) What I will carry forward from this experience is knowledge on how to combine AI and finance. I previously did not know that the two could be connected. However, now I know how to use AI to help me break down and work through complex financial problems and find out best-case scenarios for each problem through calculations. I will also utilize the DRIVER framework to work out future financial problems."
garlana	"When this semester started, I had only taken accounting classes and not many focused on finances. I viewed AI as something that was scary and should not be used. I didn't want to start using it because I did not know much about it at all. I believed that learning was done in a very specific way with lecture notes, lectures, quizzes, and exams.ÿI was surprised the most about myself with how quickly I adjusted to using AI as a tool/helper and learning the different technologies. One moment where something finally clicked was during the CAPM Session Assignment when I finally understood how to do a Sensitivity/ What-If analysis, it's importance, and how to interpret it. I felt myself grow because I could now apply my understanding and development of this process into future assignments and in my own career financial decisions.
My relationship with AI is forever changed. I feel I have truly learned how to use it to enhance my work more efficiently. I know how to integrate into projects and am more comfortable with it. Every company and business is incorporating it now, and I am glad I am able to work with it ethically and properly to help my future career path so that I am not behind.I will carry forward my confidence with AI and my better overall understanding of bond analysis and risk planning into my career and own financial decisions. I feel more comfortable in finance practices discovered in this course and am excited to keep developing my finance skills."
garris26	"1.) When this semester started, I knew some basics about finance, but not how everything connected. I also did not realize how much AI could actually help with learning. I thought it was just a shortcut, but I learned it can be a helpful tool when used correctly.
2.) As the weeks went on, I was surprised by how much better I got at explaining my work. The video assignments made me slow down and really think through each step. I began to notice that I could explain financial ideas with confidence instead of just repeating formulas.
3.) One moment that stood out was during the Time Value of Money and CAPM lessons. That was when I understood how the topics fit together through the DRIVER framework. It finally made sense that finance is about logic and reasoning, not just numbers.
4.) I feel more confident using AI and see it as a real learning partner. I am also more comfortable with not knowing everything right away because this course showed me that learning takes time and practice.5.) What I will carry forward from this class is the mindset of problem-solving. I learned to define, test, and improve my work. This course taught me how to think like a decision maker, and that skill will stay with me for a long time."
gascho	"At the start of the semester, I saw AI as a shortcut and learning as something focused mainly on completing assignments. In finance, I relied heavily on formulas without fully understanding how everything connected. I thought knowing the ""right answer"" mattered more than understanding the process.
What surprised me most was realizing how much I could understand once I slowed down and worked through problems step by step. One moment that really clicked was when I could explain why the numbers in a model changed, not just calculate them. That's when finance stopped feeling abstract and started to make sense.Now, I'm more comfortable with uncertainty and see AI as a tool that supports my thinking instead of replacing it. I'm leaving this semester more confident in my ability to learn, adapt, and explain complex ideas clearly, which is something I'll carry forward beyond this class."
rgilber	"I was focused on facts when the semester started: I knew the algorithms, I knew the financial theories, but somehow it was all segmented. Learning for me then was about outcome optimization.
What most surprised me was my integrative thinking and resilience in ambiguity. I realized that my value lay not in memorization but in integrating AI ethics, finance, and behavioral science into a cogent narrative.My ""click"" moment came during the algorithmic trading case study. I realized more than anything that the true challenge wasn't how to optimize profit but rather an ethical dilemma of how to minimize risk to human trust. Growth was identifying the most important question, not finding the perfect answer.
Now I am a bold, adaptive learner. My relationship to AI now is one of cognitive partnership in the name of exploring complexity, and uncertainty serves as a signal of opportunity. True learning happens in the messy middle.I will carry forward the value-focused, reflective mindset of the DRIVER. What I learned was that success doesn't come from perfect formulas but from the ability to navigate ambiguous and high-stake decisions. I did not only learn finance but learned to drive."
mgjorses	"Who were you when this semester started? What did you know (or think you knew) about AI, finance, and learning itself? Before I started this semester, I knew AI was a useful tool, but I never really knew how to use it. All semester long last year, all my professors told me no AI, and that it was bad. Now it is the exact opposite. It is something that I am learning to use and something that can help me with my finances and learning. I use it just about every day to help me with my homework, tests, and studying.


What surprised you most about yourself along the way? What surprised me the most about myself along the way is how unwilling I was to originally use the DRIVER method to begin. At first, I did not understand it, and I thought it was just busy work. As the assignments went on, I learned that it is a useful strategy, and I was surprised at how willing I was to change.

What's one moment where something finally ""clicked""?where you felt yourself grow? I think around midway through the semester, I realized I could take the AI outputs further beyond just the original. I could add more to them and take the reseponses that AI gave me and I could present it in a way that was better and easier to understand. I learned this from my other classes, and implemented this into this class.


Who are you now? How has your relationship with AI, with learning, with uncertainty changed? I think that my ability with AI has improved as the semester winds down. In terms of learning, I have improved and found new ways to use the AI machines to benefit me.


What will you carry forward from this experience? From this experience, I will carry forward and continue to use the DRIVER method and other ways of using AI that I have learned to help me. I want to continue to grow using AI to the best of its ability to benefit me."
sgogula	"At the start of this semester, I thought of AI, finance, and learning as mostly separate things. I viewed AI as a tool that could give quick answers, finance as a set of formulas and models to memorize, and learning as something that happened when I studied enough before an exam.ÿI was focused on getting things ""right"" rather than understanding why they worked. I didn't fully trust my own judgment yet, especially when problems were open-ended or didn't have a single correct answer.ÿWhat surprised me most was how much my confidence grew when I stopped expecting certainty. Instead of feeling uncomfortable when assumptions were unclear or data wasn't perfect, I learned to work through that uncertainty. Using AI through the DRIVER framework showed me that learning isn't about replacing my thinking but rather about strengthening it. I became more intentional about asking better questions, checking logic, and using AI as a partner rather than a shortcut.ÿ
I'm more comfortable learning in situations where I don't have all the answers. My relationship with AI has shifted from dependency to collaboration, and my relationship with learning has become more active and reflective. I trust the process more, and I trust myself more."
goldst13	"Entering the semester, having just confirmed my Finance major in Spring 2025, my foundational knowledge in the field was minimal, especially regarding the integration of Artificial Intelligence. I was initially unaware of AI's practical benefits for financial theories and analytical tools.ÿMy perspective quickly changed; I was genuinely surprised by the significant financial advantages that AI applications offer. A highlight of the course was creating the budgeting tool using n8n, which was an intriguing and rewarding introduction to workflow automation.ÿFor example, during a coding assignment focused on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), the consistent, iterative support from Gemini was instrumental in solidifying my grasp of the entire concept.ÿWhile I had previously viewed AI with skepticism, as a potential societal risk, I realized it could be leveraged effectively as a powerful tool rather than simply a 'cheat sheet.' I utilized Gemini extensively throughout the semester, transforming my learning approach.ÿMoving forward, I plan to continue incorporating tools like n8n, Google AI Studio, and Colab into my future career to inform sound financial decision-making."
gomez281	"First of all I want to start this reflection by thanking Dr. Zhang. His passion for AI and finance is translated to his classes, the way he teaches and transmits information was a big plus for me every time I stepped into class.
When this semester started, I was a finance major with very basic knowledge of concepts and finance related information. As the semester progressed, I started learning a lot more about finance, and what it means to actually be a part of this career. Through the video assignments and the DRIVER framework, as well as what we discussed during classes, I learnt about the intricacies of finance and financial work.
Along the semester I learnt lots of things about myself, but one of the ones that were evidenced in this class is that I have to trust more in my own abilities. Sometimes while I was doing the assignments and reading through the cases, I felt like this was too advanced for my current knowledge level, and that I was not going to be able to complete effectively. However, I continued surprising myself week after week with great performances in these assignments, which fueled me to keep trying my hardest and giving my best at all times.
This relates to the moment where I really felt myself grow. Around week 5-6, when I started realizing that actually putting in the extra effort and hours, showing to class consistently, were all contributing both to my learning and the development of my abilities. I felt like I was growing, so I continued to do things the way I know to do them.Looking back, after this class I have become not only a better financial analyst, with deeper knowledge of topics and concepts, but a more effective student, giving my 100% in all the assignments I turn in. My mastery of AI has improved significantly, translating to a growth in my learning potential. From this experience of being in MGMT 310 with Dr. Zhang I will carry forward not only lots more knowledge that I didn't have previously, but also a different attitude and mentality."
agorokho	"At the beginning of the semester, I had very rudimentary knowledge of Finance and thought that AI could be easily exploited.
Along the way, what surprised me the most was how easy it is to make a simple mistake with AI that, unless you have background knowledge, a topic could easily go unnoticed.
The moment it clicked was after session three which is when i learned what I stated in question 2.
My relationship with AI and learning has mainly remained the same, but I do think AI is a much more valuable tool than I did previously.
What I will carry forward is improved knowledge and the ability to use AI appropriately to my advantage."
gross132	"When I started this semester, I had used AI to help me study for classes, but I didn't truly understand the impact it could have on my learning. What I realized this semester was that it could be utilized not only to help you study, but also to learn. I would read the textbook, then use AI to help me understand the problem sets in the textbook to further expand my knowledge. I think this aspect definitely helped me improve my videos throughout the semester.
The moment it finally clicked was on the second project. I utilized my existing understanding of financial concepts. I touched up on all the concepts with Chat GPT, then once I did that, I applied that to my n8n automation tool to track whether a stock price was a good investment based on current market conditions. I have only continued to improve my skills since then. I've learned how to write better prompts and how to get the best Python code for the specific assignment/Topic that I am working on.The way that I will continue with this is by applying it to my other courses. The way that I use it, in terms of the graphs or what I need from it may change, but the main idea of using it to enhance my learning will not. I think this can even go into individual learning outside of my school work."
guadara	"When this semester began, I saw financial management as a mostly theoretical subject built around formulas, definitions, and exam problems. I thought I understood the basics?time value of money, budgeting, risk and return, and how firms make financial decisions?but my understanding felt compartmentalized. I also viewed AI as something separate from learning, more like a shortcut or an answer generator rather than a tool that could deepen understanding. Learning, to me, meant memorizing concepts well enough to apply them on homework and exams, not necessarily questioning how those concepts connected to real decisions people actually make.
As the semester progressed, what surprised me most was how much my understanding improved once I started actively building and experimenting rather than just studying. Working with budgeting tools, cash flow analysis, debt prioritization, and scenario modeling forced me to confront uncertainty in a way textbook problems never did. Topics like market efficiency, behavioral finance, cost of capital, and capital structure became more meaningful when I saw how assumptions and incentives affect outcomes. I was also surprised by how AI, when used correctly, didn't replace my thinking but actually pushed me to be more intentional and precise about my reasoning.One moment where everything ""clicked"" was when I connected cash flow analysis and risk management to real college financial decisions. Understanding how fixed versus variable expenses affect surplus, how interest rates change debt payoff strategies, and how opportunity cost plays a role in saving versus spending made the material feel personal. Instead of just calculating numbers, I began thinking in terms of trade-offs, incentives, and long-term consequences. That shift?from calculation to decision-making?felt like real growth.Now, I see myself as a more confident and adaptable learner. My relationship with AI has changed from skepticism to strategic use; I view it as a tool that supports explanation, exploration, and reflection rather than a replacement for understanding. I am also more comfortable with uncertainty, recognizing that financial management?especially in college and beyond?is rarely about finding a single ""right"" answer. What I will carry forward from this experience is the ability to combine technical knowledge with critical thinking, to ask better questions, and to use tools like AI responsibly to support lifelong learning and better financial decisions."
gupt1107	"When I first started this semester, my knowledge of anything Finance, much less anything in the Business world was very limited. My only previous coursework knowledge was taking a Intro to Marketing class in highschool which was nearly 4 years ago now. However, I did know a good amount of AI as I am a Computer Science major. In my current coursework for Computer Science, every single class has gone one of two directions, they either have fully villainized AI due to the way it is disrupting the foundation of the Computer Science world, or like this class, have fully embraced it and are adapting the material they are teaching to incorporate AI. I am someone who leans towards the second option. I think this is one of those revolutionary moments in innovation that the current generation has not seen in a minute, which is why it is disrupting so many industries.ÿ
I really appreciate how this class incorporated the innovation of AI into it. There really is no reason to sit and learn how to do financial calculations by hand over and over again anymore. While I do believe it is important to ensure you understand how items are calculated or why they are calculated in certain ways, as long as you understand that foundation, this class allowed the real work environment approach of letting the technological world automate this repetitive aspect. The videos we would make per assignment were also very applicable because it taught us how to take the qualitative component that we could code using Python, and apply our own reasoning by interpreting and providing insight through the layers of reasoning an AI chatbot cannot really take into account while discovering and reporting.Furthermore, I think the one point in this class where I finally felt like the different aspects of this class was clicking was in the Mini Project 2 where we built that AI powered tool using n8n. I had never explored that website before, in any class prior to this one when we were incorporating any AI chatbot, we would code in instances of and LLM and train it using our own datasets and prompt engineering to be able to correctly display a result. I would say this isn't as complex, regardless, just as important and efficient. It showed how AI can truly be incorporated into the Financial world to provide insight through logical and previous experiences. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience in this class, I grew not only in my financial knowledge, but also how to apply it into some of the previous knowledge I had about coding and AI. Thank you!"
ghannon	"At the beginning of the semester, I knew nothing about finance or how to code and gather information from AI. I only knew how to ask AI simple questions and get answers from it, instead of actually learn from it.
I think the most surprising thing for me was actually getting the hang of AI and the assignments. At the beginning of the course, I thought I was not going to understand how to do anything the whole semester. However, once I got into the assignments and understood the real purpose of them, I was able to succeed.
I think the moment it clicked was around unit 2. During those sessions we learned about stocks and bonds, and in class I struggled understanding the concepts. During my assignments and working with AI, the concepts were starting to click and I was now understanding the reasons we are learning those concepts.
My relationship with AI is very strong. Like I mentioned earlier, I only knew how to get answers from AI. Now, I can use AI to actually learn and create stuff with it.ÿ
This experience will really benefit me in the future. Everybody is always talking about how AI is going to be everywhere and it is going to be important in my job career. By understanding how to use AI, I have this skill the that companies most likely will look for in their employees."
lhardymo	"Before this semester started, I thought of AI and finance as two separate things. I thought of finance as a lot of equations and numbers that if used well could earn someone a lot of money. I thought of AI has another search engine or a tool to help me study. I never really thought that the two of them could be combined. I think the thing that surprised me the most this semester was the wealth of AI programs available on the internet. I discovered this during the mini projects as using these automation tools was something I had never done before. A moment where it ""clicked"" this semester was during my first mini project when I created a (simple) retirement calculator. This first mini project connected everything for me in my mind of using AI and finance together to create a tool that provides benefit for the world.ÿ I realized that this is the entire goal of this class.Now, I see AI as twofold. First, I see AI as a tool that automates mundane tasks such as checking the news or giving me basic financial advice. With one click, I can have AI do so many things for me instead of figuring it out for myself. Second, I see AI as not just an automation tool but an augmentation tool. AI has greatly helped deepen my understanding in financial concepts and I have been able to apply this to multiple other classes this semester. From this class, I have seen AI as not something to avoid (like many professors say) but rather something to embrace. AI is clearly the future and it'd be foolish to avoid it and it'd be wise to know how to use it to the best of our abilities."
gjhennin	"Who were you when this semester started? What did you know (or think you knew) about AI, finance, and learning itself? I was a student who knew about AI and used it for practical things such as emails, etc, but never used it for finance. I also automatically linked finance with money when I now know its way more diverse than that.


What surprised you most about yourself along the way? The thing that surprised me the most along the way was just some finance concepts that I now understand way better and will help me in life along with using DRIVER mindset to break down real world problems.

What's one moment where something finally ""clicked""?where you felt yourself grow? About midway through the semester when I really started to understand DRIVER and how you can use that to break down and analyze finance.


Who are you now? How has your relationship with AI, with learning, with uncertainty changed? I am a student who was a broader intelligence of finance items and how they can play a major part in life decisions. My relationship has grown a lot with AI discovering all the ways it can be applied whether its for work, school, or something else major.


What will you carry forward from this experience? I will carry forward certain aspects of finance that will help with major life moments such as buying a house or car etc and how certain scenarios ply a major role in the outcome."
herre163	"When I look back at who I was sixteen weeks ago, I see someone standing at the edge of two vast, intimidating oceans: Finance and Artificial Intelligence. Honestly, I knew very little about how to merge the two. I viewed financial management as a rigid set of formulas I had to memorize, and AI as a buzzword that I wasn't quite sure how to apply practically. I thought I had to have all the answers in my head, and the idea of tackling complex financial problems felt overwhelming. I was a student prepared to study hard, but I wasn't yet a ""driver.""The biggest surprise?and the turning point of my semester?came when I finally stopped trying to do it all alone and started utilizing Gemini. The ""click"" moment wasn't just getting an answer to a homework question; it was realizing that I could treat AI as a thought partner rather than just a search engine. When I began feeding financial scenarios into Gemini, asking it to explain theÿwhyÿbehind the numbers or to help me brainstorm solutions for complex case studies, the fog lifted. I realized that I didn't need to be a walking encyclopedia of finance; I just needed to ask the right questions and know how to navigate the answers.Now, as I close this chapter, I feel a profound shift in my confidence. I am no longer intimidated by the unknown because I know I have a powerful tool in my pocket. My relationship with learning has evolved from rote memorization to active problem-solving. I know that in the future, whether I am managing personal investments or handling corporate finances, I won't be stuck. I have learned that AI can help me find solutions, break down barriers, and turn data into decisions. I am taking forward not just financial literacy, but the ability to drive with technology?a skill that I know will be my greatest asset in the years to come."
hessi	"Before this semester, I knew little to none about finance. As I am only a Sophomore, I have not taken strictly a finance course before. I knew some previous knowledge from accounting, but nothing that went into too much depth. In regards to AI, Ive used ChatGPT and Gemini before, but I never used in-depth prompts like I have used in this class, I didn't know how to train the AI before regarding the prompts I input.ÿAlong the way Ive learned more about my resilience more than anything. I've pushed myself so hard to succeed by learning how to get the best input out of the prompts I use with Gemini, and with this I've been able to get the best results. I've learned how ""roleplaying"" can be used effectively to get the best responses. By using ""I am a new finance student"" I have gotten outputs that not only explain the concepts, but they further my understanding, especially by using the DRIVER method. This method allows me to strengthen my understanding of finance concepts, but also communicate this in a simple, but effective way; it's not just a way of learning, but instead a way of presenting and speaking, similar to the STAR method used for interviews.ÿI will continue to implement the DRIVER method in my frameworks following this class. Not only in the way I present things, but in the way I study, the way I explain things, and the way I code. I am very grateful for the opportunities through this class. Thank you."
higbieh	"Before this semester begun, I had no idea everything that ai could do for me. I hardly used it before this class, and I had no idea how to leverage it to make anything. I surprised myself the most from the creation of the videos and how I could understand python code by the end of the course. That is something that I had no idea id ever figure out and I hope to code more in the future to help me do other things that could be automated in my life.The moment that something finally clicked for me was around session 4 where I started to actually follow the DRIVER framework to a T. This helped me organize the code in a way that made the videos flow better and also made the code that I created far more comprehensive. My relationship with AI is now very positive, I find myself writing far more complex prompts for my finance studies that I do on my own time. I find it very helpful and exciting to gain knowledge to put me ahead of my peers in the finance world. The DRIVER framework will definitely continue on as it has already helped me learn so much more than just asking a simple one-part question."
hindsj	"At the beginning of the semester, I didn't have any formal education on finances, just what i had researched on my own and a class I took in accounting the semester before. For me going into it, financials were more about just figuring out the numbers instead of making decisions. I also had used AI like chat GPT on previous class works to just help me get through it, without really having any of the DRIVER command over it.ÿThe biggest takeaway I have from the course I feel is that financial decisions isn't really about figuring out a single correct answer, but measuring and comparing the alternative options against each other to figure out what should work the best. I found the analysis of company alternatives harder at first where i was trying to compare different options the company had proposed, which had to get me to think about the strategic fit for the companies and not just the numbers.Another concept I find extremely useful is the Time Value of Money. This is going to be one of the biggest takeaway from the courses right now as I am a college student and my greatest asset is time. I will be able to take money I have today and through choices made considering TVM, I will have plenty of time to compound the money and grow its value. I can also take that value generated down the road to invest in a house or real estate that will also generate value for me.Now at the end of the class I feel more educated on the concepts of finances and how to manage them. I also feel as if the DRIVER framework helped a lot because now I will be able to command AI to use whenever I will need it to assist me in doing my work more efficiently."
ghubertz	"When this semester started, I never really knew much about the features of using AI, and that it could give me code. I never really thought you could use AI for finance until I learned you could put the basic equations that we learn about into it and give it numbers. Something I learned about myself along the way was that I'm pretty good at explaining the outputs and how to expand ideas off of them. The moment when something ""clicked"" was my financial explanations and how to explain each method of DRIVER well.ÿI think I've understood AI better now through this class in using it as an assistant, and that you don't have to use it as a crutch. I felt more confident in the models I was being given. I really enjoyed how the model was able to change easily if you wanted to change some factors. I will carry forward from this experience how to create solutions to financial problems. I will also have the AI create models or graphs that can give me 5-year or multiple-year returns and determine if investments are worth it or not."
chuisman	"At the beginning of this semester, I was someone who valued ai in my learning but not someone who had all the tools to build to my fullest potential. I was also someone who had an understanding of finance basics but though in the short term, not the long term. The thing that surprised myself the most would be how interested I would get in the power of AI agents. The moment where this was realized was actually during the development of my capstone project, when my learning and confidence had intersected and I truly felt like I could achieve anything. I am now someone who sees my creativity as the limiting factor to build anything. I will carry forward the DRIVER structure and the long-term goal thinking that Dr. Z and his class had given me. Thank you professor, I believe this class made my last semester at Purdue well worth it."
jacob269	"At the start of the semester, I wasn't sure what the class was about. I knew very little about using AI, especially for financial usage. I took some previous classes on Python and Labs, but this class was different.
What surprised me most was my ability to pick up certain tools and use them effectively.ÿ
A moment where I felt a click was the first Mini Project, I learned how to build a financial calculator and realized anyone can you this to their advantage in the real world.
Now I love using AI, I use it I all my classes the permit it. It is a very helpful tool that I think everyone should get familiar with.
Moving forward I will continue to learn AI and what it brings to the table, I'm sure at some point everyone will excel with AI usage."
jain789	"I was someone who was scared to use AI and had know experience how to code in any langauge. I was terrified when I found out it was a class where we were going to use python. I knew a good amount of information regarding finance but not about AI.ÿ
What surprised me is how we are able to use AI and our mind to become a powerful tool. AI and our brain alone arent unique and smart enough, but if we combine both, it becomes more powerful.
Was when I decided to give this class a chance rather than dropping it because I was scared to code. I learned how to use python and AI. How to promopt scripts and manipulate AI to our liking. How we can analyze and interpret code.ÿ
I would say my perspective on AI has defenetly changed. I am a lot more comfortable using AI on an every day basis and knowing how to ask it something that I want to. How I can use it to make my life easier.ÿ
I will carry forward the valuable insights I learned on financial management and DRIVER with me. I will use the concepts I learned and how I can use AI through careful prompting."
ojanaman	"At the start of the semester, I was a sophomore studying Computer Science at Purdue, motivated to explore the intersection of computer science and finance. I had a solid understanding of AI basics and machine learning principles, including how models learn from data, and I was aware of how large hedge funds leverage AI and deep learning to inform trading decisions through my involvement in the Boiler Quantitative Finance Group. Taking Professor Zhang's MGMT 31000 Financial Management course was an opportunity to strengthen my financial knowledge while integrating my technical skills.
What surprised me most throughout the course was just how powerful and efficient AI tools have become in solving finance-related problems. I was particularly struck by the potential of AI to transform the way we analyze financial data and make decisions. A pivotal moment for me came during Mini Project 3, when I built FinTherapy using Google AI Studio?a Financial Health Advisor that analyzed past spending, explained spending psychology, and proposed a 90-day budget transformation plan. That project solidified my understanding of the DRIVER framework and highlighted how AI and finance can be combined to create impactful, real-world solutions.Now, I feel more confident as an aspiring finance professional with a strong foundation in AI and financial programming. My relationship with AI, learning, and uncertainty has deepened, and I appreciate the value of adapting to new tools and technologies to remain competitive. Moving forward, I will carry with me not only the practical knowledge of finance, investing, and management but also the DRIVER framework as a guiding principle for problem-solving. This experience has reinforced the importance of AI in shaping future industries and has strengthened my commitment to integrating technology and finance in my personal and professional growth."
ajervis	"At the start of the semester, I viewed AI mainly as a tool for quick answers and efficiency. I thought finance was mostly about formulas, rules, and getting the correct numerical result. Learning, for me, meant understanding just enough to complete assignments correctly. I did not fully see how AI could be used to deepen understanding or support real decision-making in finance.


2. I was surprised by how much my mindset shifted. I became more comfortable not having immediate answers and more willing to explore problems step by step. I also realized that I could use AI to support my thinking rather than rely on it. This helped me engage more deeply with financial concepts and trust my own reasoning.
3. A key moment was when I started seeing finance problems as decision-making tools rather than isolated calculations. Using AI to test assumptions, walk through logic, and evaluate tradeoffs helped me connect the math to real-world outcomes. That was when finance felt practical instead of abstract.
4. Now, I see myself as a more independent and reflective learner. I use AI as a collaborative tool to explore ideas, check reasoning, and clarify concepts, not as a shortcut. I am more comfortable with uncertainty and view it as part of the learning process rather than something to avoid.
5. I will carry forward the mindset of using AI responsibly to enhance learning while still relying on my own critical thinking. I have learned that growth comes from asking better questions, staying curious, and being willing to work through uncertainty. This approach will be valuable not only in finance, but in future academic and professional challenges as well."
john3952	"1. Coming into this semester, I was already strong at understanding finance through real world trends, especially in financial and economic news. With a background in Political Science and a recent major change into Finance, I was used to thinking about markets through policy, incentives, and global events. This was my first true introduction to financial management, and I did not know what to expect. I am especially grateful that AI was prioritized in this class, because it is clearly essential to the field I am entering.
2. What surprised me most was how much more confident I became turning concepts into tools. Using the DRIVER framework alongside AI helped me contextualize financial management ideas in practical ways, rather than treating them as abstract formulas. I found myself thinking less about getting the right answer and more about understanding how decisions actually affect outcomes.
3. The moment everything clicked was during the mini project where I built a startup cash burn rate calculator. That project forced me to define the problem clearly, think through assumptions, and use AI to test scenarios and refine logic. For the first time, finance felt intuitive and creative instead of rigid. I was not just learning a concept, I was building something that could be used in the real world.
4. Now, I feel genuinely comfortable using AI for financial purposes. This is especially meaningful as I prepare for my internship at JPMorgan Chase next summer in NYC, knowing that JPMorgan has one of the largest in house LLMs in the financial industry. This class helped me see AI not as a shortcut, but as a professional tool for analysis and decision making.5. What I will carry forward is the confidence to learn in uncertain environments and the ability to DRIVE my thinking with AI. I did not just learn financial management, I learned how to apply it in a way that feels relevant, adaptable, and aligned with where finance is headed."
kim4574	"At the start of the semester, finance concepts like time value of money and risk felt like separate topics, and AI seemed loosely related rather than integral to financial decision-making. Over the course, those ideas became more connected: TVM and risk emerged as the structure behind valuation, forecasting, and assessing uncertainty, rather than isolated formulas.
Working within the DRIVER framework highlighted how AI and finance interact in practice. Different AI tools, such as Colab and Replit proved useful for different purposes, such as calculation, explanation, data retrieval, or scenario generation. The validation step in DRIVER was especially important: it showed that financial logic and outputs must be checked systematically, rather than accepted at face value just because they came from an AI system.
By the end of the semester, AI appeared less as a competitor and more as infrastructure that can extend analytical capacity when guided by sound financial reasoning and clear constraints. The main takeaway is a more disciplined approach to problem solving: connect concepts, design workflows deliberately, validate results, and iterate, using AI to complement rather than replace human judgment.ÿ
As AI becomes more important as a tool in the workforce, it has become increasingly critical to grow alongside the technology and make sure that I know how to utilize it to meet my personal and a business's needs. This course took a unique approach to financial management, and was unorthodox, but I believe that the unique applications of AI I learned throughout the semester will serve me in the workforce looking forward."
krame144	"When this semester started, my mindset was purely set on just passing through this class with at least a B. I am a Marketing major with zero interest and knowledge in finance. As for AI, I knew it could answer a lot of questions and keeps growing day by day. I have used it to develop code before, so that wasn't anything new to me.
What surprised me the most was my endurance to keep going. Some of these sessions were really hard and confusing for me. Instead of giving up and just taking a zero for the grade, I kept going and used AI as a tool to help me, rather than against me.A moment where something ""clicked"" was session 9: Cost of Capital. I really understood the Weighted Average Cost of Capital and everything that went into the formula, along with considering bonds, the capital structure and equity beta.
My relationship has changed for the better. I understand why this course used so much AI integration and that is because AI is not going away anytime soon. It is better to use AI as tool in my life and something I should work alongside with.
Moving forward, I will think of AI as not only a financial tool, but as so much more. It can be used for good, such as solving code that I am stuck on."
ckubly	"When this semester started, I was somebody who viewed this class as just any other class in my path to graduation. I had no idea how much this class will help strengthen my knowledge in finance and AI. I knew little to nothing about financial management, only really knowing personal finance skills. In regards to AI, instead of using it as my personal assistant who can ease the everyday qualities of school, I used to just give me answers. What surprised me along the way is how DRIVER would impact my other classes as well. It helped me answer questions I was confused on while helping me retain the information.

One moment in this course where it finally clicked was when I was doing the first mini project. I had been struggling with the entire DRIVER mindset in general because it is a completely different way of thinking and utilizing AI. When I was prompting my chat box for the first mini project, it all of the sudden clicked and I understood the entire DRIVER framework, getting an A on the project.ÿ
Now, I am somebody who is confident using AI in my everyday life. However, not just as a tool to give me the answer, but by learning, retaining, and having the ability to teach the answer to others. I am somebody who will succeed in my career because I can confidently use AI to guide me through problems I have never seen before. Finally, AI knowledge/comfortability will carry me forward from this class. Being comfortable using AI and understanding its capabilities is half of the battle. AI is the future of not only the business world, but is the future itself. I'm proud that I can navigate the corporate world with my AI assistant by my side."
tkukrej	"At the start of this semester, I saw finance as mostly formulas and right answers, and AI as a tool that simply gave quick solutions. Learning felt very structured study the material, apply it, move on. I didn't think much about uncertainty or decision-making beyond what was taught in class.
What surprised me most was how my thinking changed. I started questioning assumptions instead of just accepting results, and I realized uncertainty is a normal part of finance, not something to avoid. The moment things really clicked was using the DRIVER framework, which helped me slow down, break problems apart, and understand why decisions made sense.
Now, I'm more comfortable with not having perfect answers right away. I see AI as a thinking partner rather than a shortcut, and I approach learning with more curiosity and confidence. This experience didn't just teach me finance but helped me use AI correctly."
kuper	At the start of the semester I thought I knew a lot more about AI than I currently do. I always had AI help teach me how to do problems but I never knew that I could create an AI website to solve for a specific problem. What surprised me most was that I am very interested in the concept of AI and intelligence. Once moment I felt clicked more me was when I was struggling with mini project 3 and then I figure out how to prompt AI better to make sure AI knew what I was saying. I am a new person now in comparison to my AI knowledge I understand how to prompt AI and solve problems using AI and validating those problems on my own. Some things I will carry from this experience is that AI is a very useful tool if used the right way. AI is one of the most useful tools to learn.
ajkurtz	"Throughout the semester I really felt myself grow as an AI user, No longer did I feel I was using A.I to just do my homework for me or make something, I felt that me and AI were collaborators.ÿ
The most breakthrough moment I had was on the Mini-Project 1. The first part of the project, following the video was easy. But when I was challenged to move past the tutorial it really was a struggle to ship a working AI agent. But using gemini, and ChatGPT I was able to implement their suggestions and problem solving ability to make a working monthy expense tracker. This breakthrough moment really helped me to work with AI instead of telling AI what to do I had to problem solve with AI. Now I feel like I can take a complex problem and truly problem solve with AI. Not just have AI spit out some information.From this class I will carry forward new ideas and thought on using and interacting with AI. I feel that I have been given a wealth of new ideas and tools regarding AI that will be invaluable to me in this current state of techological necessity in the current job market."
kwon273	"At the start of this semester, I saw myself as a traditional business student who believed that success in finance came from mastering formulas, memorizing frameworks, and applying them correctly under exam conditions. I understood AI mostly as a productivity shortcut?something that could explain concepts faster, summarize readings, or help debug code. I thought learning was largely linear: study the material, practice enough problems, and eventually reach the right answer.What surprised me most along the way was how much my mindset mattered compared to my technical ability. I realized that I often approached uncertainty with the goal of eliminating it as quickly as possible, rather than sitting with it and using it as a tool for deeper understanding. I also surprised myself by how willing I became to experiment?testing ideas, building imperfect models, and asking ""why"" instead of just ""how."" I learned that discomfort was not a sign of failure, but a signal that real learning was happening.One moment where something truly ""clicked"" was when I stopped using AI to get answers and started using it to challenge my thinking. Instead of asking for solutions, I began asking AI to explain trade-offs, test assumptions, or argue against my conclusions. That shift made concepts in finance?such as capital allocation, valuation uncertainty, and scenario analysis?feel more real and less mechanical. I wasn't just completing assignments anymore; I was reasoning like an analyst.
Now, I see myself as a more adaptive learner. My relationship with AI has changed from dependence to collaboration. AI is no longer a crutch, but a thinking partner?one that helps me explore uncertainty rather than avoid it. I am more comfortable not knowing the answer immediately, and more confident in my ability to arrive at one through iteration and reflection.What I will carry forward from this experience is the understanding that learning is not about certainty, but about judgment. In finance, in technology, and in life, the most valuable skill is not having the right answer?but knowing how to ask better questions, evaluate imperfect information, and keep learning even when the path is unclear."
lee4972	"I felt I had a decent understanding of AI, finance, and my learning style when this semester began. I assumed that learning was essentially memorizing information till it stuck, finance was a collection of formulas and rules, and AI was merely a tool that could automate chores or provide fast answers. I assumed that I already understood how I worked: work quickly, follow my gut, and persevere. In actuality, though, it wasn't until I was compelled to slow down and think more deeply that I realized how much more complex all of this could be.The thing that surprised me the most was how much I discovered about myself without anticipating it. I had no idea how flexible I was or how fast I could change my perspective once I stopped viewing uncertainty as something to be afraid of. I was also taken aback by how much I relied on creativity and problem-solving rather than merely memorizing protocols. I began to truly appreciate the process of solving problems rather than just arriving at the solution. I occasionally found myself thinking, ""Dang, I'm actually getting good at this,"" in a genuine rather than forced sense.
When I began to see AI as something that broadens my perspective on learning and thinking rather than as a quick fix, that's when things really clicked. As I worked through a challenging task, I realized that I was utilizing AI to test various strategies, question my presumptions, and comprehend the underlying logic rather than just asking for answers. That change seemed significant. At that moment, I felt like I was changing from someone who was looking for quick fixes to someone who genuinely appreciated the logic behind them.
I've changed since the beginning of the semester. My connection with AI is more about teamwork than convenience; I see it as something that challenges me rather than merely speeding up my work. I now approach learning with greater openness, patience, and, to be honest, confidence. Additionally, uncertainty now feels like room for growth rather than turmoil. I'm constantly learning things, but I have a better idea of who I am and what I'm capable of.
This encounter has given me an entirely new perspective on learning and problem-solving. This semester has given me more patience, curiosity, and faith in my capacity to solve problems, even when I don't fully understand what I'm doing at first. I've discovered that accepting uncertainty rather than resisting it typically produces stronger concepts and results. Thank Mr> Zhang!"
lee4991	"Initially with AI, I used it sometimes to answer questions and not really to dissect it and use it for complex codes and analysis. Now, I am able to use AI as a tool and resource to expand my learning and abilities. With finance, I had basic understandings but now I have a much better idea on how finance works and how they're used in the financial world. Overall, this semester was a different version of learning that I have never experienced. This approach made me very present and also pay attention to small rules and details but also why they are important and affect the final result. I was surprised how smart and also how many different AI tools there are. I never knew about Gemini or n8n or Replit. These platforms were extremely useful and interesting during the semester. I was also surprised by how DRIVER made me really think and find purpose in my work. Why was I doing x? What purpose was x? During the middle of the semester, I was able to apply DRIVER into my other coursework and life without the need to check back how DRIVEr worked. I was able to seamlessly apply it which clicked in my brain in how I can grow as a student, learner, and creator. Now, with AI I am able to ask better questions and utlize the tool to help me. I'm better able to cater my findings and intentions to be beneficial for me. Now on, I will make sure to use DRIVER and my abilities in using AI with my future works. I will make sure to apply my skills of being a learner from this class to my other academic and professional works in the future."
eliban	"At the beginning of this semester, I came into Financial Management thinking of AI as a shortcut rather than a skill. I viewed it mostly as a tool to get quick answers, not something that could deepen my understanding of finance or change how I learn. In terms of finance, I felt comfortable with surface-level concepts but often relied on formulas without fully understanding the ""why"" behind them. I also believed that learning meant getting things right quickly, and uncertainty usually felt like a sign that I was falling behind.
What surprised me most about myself was how much my confidence grew once I allowed myself to ask better questions instead of rushing to answers. Using AI forced me to slow down and explain my thinking, especially when working through financial problems or interpreting results. I became more patient with myself and more willing to engage with material even when it didn't immediately make sense.One moment that really ""clicked"" for me was when I started using AI to walk through financial reasoning step by step rather than just checking final answers. Seeing how assumptions, inputs, and outputs connected helped me understand financial decision-making as a process instead of a set of isolated calculations. That shift made the material feel more meaningful, and I could tell I was actually learning instead of memorizing.Now, I see myself as a more intentional learner. My relationship with AI has changed from dependence to collaboration. I use it to challenge my thinking, clarify concepts, and explore uncertainty rather than avoid it. I'm more comfortable not having immediate answers and more confident in my ability to figure things out. Moving forward, I'll carry this mindset with me: learning happens when I engage deeply, ask questions, and stay open to uncertainty."
liu4182	"At the beginning of this semester, I saw AI as a powerful but distant tool, and finance as a structured discipline built on formulas, models, and ""right answers."" I believed learning meant understanding content well enough to apply it correctly. I was focused on outcomes which getting the calculation right, following the steps, producing the expected result. Uncertainty felt like something to minimize, not explore.
What surprised me most along the way was not how much I learned, but how much my mindset changed. I realized that my real growth did not come from mastering any single formula or financial concept, but from learning how to think, test, and iterate. I discovered that I am far more capable of navigating ambiguity than I thought. Instead of waiting for clarity, I learned to create it?by asking better questions, refining assumptions, and using AI as a thinking partner rather than a shortcut.There was a moment when everything finally clicked: when I stopped using AI to ""get answers"" and started using it to challenge my reasoning. That shift is from execution to judgment and changed how I approached problems. I began to see finance not as static rules, but as a decision-making language under uncertainty. That was the point where I felt myself grow, not just as a student, but as a thinker.
Now, I see myself differently. My relationship with AI is no longer one of dependence or fear, but of collaboration. Learning feels less like absorbing information and more like designing systems for understanding. Uncertainty no longer feels like a weakness. it feels like space for strategy, creativity, and insight.What I will carry forward from this experience is confidence. It is not in having the right answers, but in knowing how to search for them. I learned how to define problems, represent them clearly, implement solutions thoughtfully, validate outcomes, and reflect honestly. That ability?to DRIVE with AI?is something I know will stay with me far beyond this course."
liu4186	"At the beginning of this semester, I was honestly not very confident about my understanding of either finance or artificial intelligence. My knowledge of finance was very limited, and my use of AI was quite basic. I mostly treated AI as a question-and-answer tool: I asked something, and it gave me a response. I did not really understand how AI could be integrated into learning, analysis, or creation, nor did I see it as something I could actively use to build or design meaningful tools.
As the semester progressed, what surprised me most was discovering how powerful AI could be as a learning partner rather than just an information source. AI made many topics that once seemed to require extensive professional knowledge much more accessible. More importantly, it helped me realize that I was capable of creating things myself. Building tools like a Fed-signal analyst or a financial scenario generator showed me that I could move beyond passive learning and actually produce something functional and insightful. At the same time, the DRIVER framework gradually became more than just a class requirement?it evolved into a general way I approach and structure my thinking when facing new problems.
There was a clear moment of realization when I felt that I had truly grown. I began to understand that the world is changing extremely fast, and with the support of AI, what matters most for the future may not be how many technical skills you already possess, but the quality of your ideas and your ability to innovate. Even if I lack certain technical skills, AI can help fill in those gaps. This shift in mindset made me feel more confident and less intimidated by uncertainty. These made me believe that I can really build something new!
Now, I see myself differently in relation to artificial intelligence, learning, and uncertainty. AI is no longer something I simply use to get answers; it is a tool I collaborate with to explore ideas, test assumptions, and build solutions. Learning has become more active and experimental, and uncertainty feels less threatening because I know I have tools and frameworks to help me navigate it.
One important lesson I will take away from this experience is that AI is not always correct. Especially when dealing with precise calculations or financial data, it is more reliable to have AI generate code or structured models rather than blindly trusting its direct answers. This has taught me the importance of judgment, critical thinking, and verification when working with AI.In the end, I believe the core value of this course was not simply teaching me financial knowledge. Instead, it was a form of intellectual awakening. It showed me what AI is capable of, encouraged me to stay curious, and motivated me to actively embrace a rapidly evolving world with an open and forward-looking mindset."
lopez613	"When this semester started, I saw myself as a competent, structured student?someone comfortable with finance formulas, frameworks, and ""right answers,"" and cautiously curious about AI. I understood AI mostly as a tool for efficiency: something that could summarize, calculate, or speed up work, but not fundamentally change how I thought or learned. Learning, to me, was largely transactional: master the material, apply the model, get the result. I believed uncertainty was something to minimize as quickly as possible.
What surprised me most was how much of my growth came not from getting answers, but from wrestling with ambiguity. I didn't expect to become more reflective about how I think?how assumptions sneak into models, how framing a question changes the outcome, and how often confidence can mask untested beliefs. I also surprised myself by becoming more comfortable exposing incomplete thinking, especially when using AI as a thought partner rather than a solution engine.The moment that truly ""clicked"" was when I stopped asking AI to give me the answer and started asking it to challenge my reasoning. In finance work?whether building valuation logic, stress-testing assumptions, or explaining tradeoffs to different stakeholders?I felt a shift from execution to judgment. That was the point where learning felt less like accumulation and more like calibration: refining instincts, not just inputs.Now, I see myself as a learner who's more adaptive and less afraid of not knowing. My relationship with AI has evolved into something closer to collaboration?an iterative dialogue that sharpens thinking rather than replaces it. I'm more comfortable sitting with uncertainty, using it as a signal to ask better questions instead of rushing to closure. Going forward, I'll carry the habit of reflective learning: treating tools as amplifiers of judgment, valuing process as much as outcome, and staying curious even when the path forward isn't clearly defined."
lyu147	"The course changed me a lot in the way I see finance and business. I used to think that we were all eventually going to get replaced by AI in the finance industry. However, as we got deeper and deeper into the course material, I realized that the best work is done by AI and humans working together. A human with AI's help is stronger than AI and humans individually. This was definitely the biggest surprise I had in this class. One moment it clicked was the first time AI built an app for me in Mini Project 1. Seeing the app come together step by step is an experience I have not had before. I'm now much more used to working with AI and recognizing its strengths as well as its flaws. I'll be sure to turn to AI's help more in the future when faced with financial decisions."
cmainvil	"1. During the start of the semester, I used AI as a simple tool. I was using it for basic learning needs to help me understand things I didn't know in my classes and that was about all it spanned to. As far as finance, I thought I knew way more about finance at the beginning of the semester compared to now. I now see how ignorant that mentality is, and how it is more important to be curious than knowledgable in the early stages of your career. As a learner, I learned that trial and error is more valuable than any exam could teach me. The process of learning how to get better with AI is full of failing and trying again.ÿ2. My perseverance. Many times in the semester I was frustrated with the outcomes of my tools but I always overcame that mental roadblock.ÿ3. One moment where things really clicked was after I got the 50% on one of the assignments. I was super upset with myself as I felt like I put so much effort in and got nothing back out of it. But I took that moment as a learning opportunity to see what I was doing wrong and I poured all I had into the next assignment and did very well. That was the moment that the DRIVER ideology really clicked and I saw how it was applicable to other areas of life and not just this finance class.ÿ4. I feel more comfortable with AI. I understand how it works (very simply) and have a better grasp of its powers. My relationship with learning became more compassionate. You can't be so hard on yourself for trying and not getting the outcome you expected. Always take those bad moments as a learning experience. My relationship with the idea of uncertainty has become more comfortable. When uncertain, I use the tools at my disposable to get a better idea of whatever I am uncertain about.ÿ5. I will carry forward the DRIVER method and all the knowledge I learned while using AI. I want to continue to drive the AI, not let the AI be my brain.ÿThank you Professor Zhang, this course was one of the most valuable courses I have taken here at Purdue."
amandhad	"Hi there, I'm Anvitha Mandhadi a junior studying Business Analytics & Information Management and I've always been interested by finance and AI but never did I think I'd get the privilege of taking a course with the both of them. I knew the basics of finance, or so I thought I did through the accounting and economics classes I took. All I knew about AI was the large language model chat gpt. I knew about the kiss principle but I never heard of a driver framework, but it has truly been life changing.ÿ
What surprised me the most is my ability to learn these new concepts and build my own ai model!! I never thought that's something I can do but with the help of this class and n8n it was such a cool experience. That was also the time where something clicked and I felt myself grow because with the right resources, tools, and tutorials at our disposal, you can do pretty much anything.ÿMy relationship with AI, learning, and uncertainty has changed so much because I know that it is truly limit less. We're able to code, create financial models, compare between forecasting models, calculate complex financial equations, and do so much more. I will definitely use the driver framework for when tackling problems and I'll try to leverage AI to my advantage."
mangal2	"When the semester started, I had a decent understanding of AI and finance because of previous classes I had taken before and use of basic AI tools like ChatGPT, but very limited.ÿ I thought I had a good knowledge of finance and above average knowledge of AI since I knew about a lot of the new release technology that people were slow to adapt to. Looking back now, I release how surface level all that knowledge I had was. What surprised me was how much room I had left to grow and the avenues that I had to traverse to get there. Topics that I dismissed as too hard to complete such as coding in python and finance concepts were coming easy to understand for me after learning how to use AI tools to my advantage. It felt like something clicked when I ran code in google Colab generated by myself for the first time, and it actually ran. No errors, no bugs, but fully functional code that I could use to help aid my finance journey. I am now a finance student who is a lot more knowledgeable about AI and more importantly the modern tools I can use to learn. This course, I learned how to apply modern technology to my benefit and use code as a way to aid my learning. I will carry forward not only the information I learned in this course, but the way I applied them and the DRIVER method."
amanick	"When this semester began, I thought I had AI neatly compartmentalized: clever tools for automating finance tasks and offering a slight analytical edge. Learning was about accumulating knowledge, proving competence, and minimizing mistakes. I envisioned AI as an efficiency upgrade, bolting onto my existing skill set. I was confident in my finance knowledge and believed AI would help me move faster.
However, I discovered significant growth potential in mindset, not technical capability. I felt vulnerable at times but energized by pushing past discomfort. Some experiments failed, and conversations exposed gaps, but each recovery made me more resilient. I learned to be curious and critical, understanding everything immediately wasn't necessary, and uncertainty wasn't a weakness.A pivotal moment was when I stopped treating AI as a black box assistant and treated it as a collaborator. I shifted from transactional questions to probing its reasoning, challenging assumptions, and comparing perspectives. I realized I wasn't just delegating tasks; I was learning to think with AI, interrogating models, and balancing intuition with computational insights. Growth wasn't about ""using AI""; it was about learning alongside it.
Now, I'm more comfortable admitting my ignorance and deliberate in exploring the unknown. My relationship with AI has evolved into a reflective one: a tool that frames questions differently and forces me to clarify my judgment. Learning feels less like checking boxes and more like iterating, testing, and refining. Uncertainty no longer feels like a void to avoid; it's a space for creativity and rigor.I'll carry forward a growth mindset?staying curious, embracing ambiguity, and using AI as a catalyst for deeper thinking. I'll seek a balance between data and intuition, speed and reflection, automation and human evaluation, empathy, and adaptation."
marsh86	"I didn't really know anything about finance in the beginning of the semester. I had taken econ and accounting classes but I never truly understood it. AI has just been something that I use as a tool to explain a prompt if I don't understand to to ask a random question for fun.ÿ
I don't know that anything really surprised me. I did learn more about AI and how to use it and learned that AI can be very cool and interesting to use but can also be frustrating at times.
While using AI throughout the class I feel it really helped me to understand some key points, although I was still confused at times it helped to have another tool to explain something to me in a simple way that I could understand.
At the end of the semester I see how AI can help me in more detailed ways and that I can use AI to help me further my understanding when needed.
I will carry the fact that AI can be confusing, but when being specific and direct with the prompts, it is easy to use and can be very helpful."
am156	"Starting this semester, I was someone who really wasn't knowledgeable about working with AI. I had only been recently introduced to the different things AI could help with like answering questions and brainstorming. Overall I was not aware of the in depth applications that I could create with AI by being intentional with my prompts.
I was surprised by how fast I was able to take up this AI coding and finance aspect, especially because I wasn't used to using AI as intentionally and as thorough, especially when it came to something I was currently learning, financial management and coding.ÿ
The moment it clicked for me was when we had to create our own n8n AI agent. It made me realize how much I actually knew and understood of the process and what I wanted ultimately.ÿ
I feel like I have grown into someone who won't be as lost when it comes to navigated AI, especially now that I know how to use it for more than answering questions. I can now use it to create things beyond that and more. I feel comfortable with the knowledge I have acquired from where I stand right now. The foundation I have is solid and I know that I can comfortably lean back on my skills as I continue to learn more about AI.
I will carry the experience of using AI to code and being more intentional and thorough when it comes to writing my prompts. Those are things that I will continue to use and develop as AI evolves and continues to advance."
mccar169	"Honestly, when the semester started, I was a bit intimidated by the finance side of things. I looked at AI mostly as a shortcut or something to write a quick email or summarize a boring article. I didn't really see it as a ""partner,"" and I definitely didn't think it could help me understand complex financial logic. I was just focused on getting the right answers to get the grade.ÿ
What surprised me most was realizing that AI can actually be wrong, and that catching it being wrong made me smarter. The moment it really clicked was once when I was stuck, but instead of asking for the answer, I had a back-and-forth conversation with the AI to break down the concept. Suddenly, I wasn't just copy-pasting; I was debating the logic. That's when I felt like I was actually in the driver's seat.I feel much more comfortable with uncertainty now. I used to panic if I didn't know how to start a problem, but now I know I have a tool to help me brainstorm and structure my thinking. I see learning less about memorizing formulas and more about knowing how to ask the right questions to get to the solution. I'm leaving this class not just knowing finance but knowing how to think through problems with technology as a co-pilot."
mcnama34	"When the semester started I thought AI was a another tool to help me with my homework. Or like another Google that I could ask any silly question that came into my head. I never thought about it as the tool I now know it to be. As for the world of finance I will say my eyes have been opened. There is much more to it than stocks and balance sheets.ÿ
The thing that surprised me the most about this class was how much I could really do with AI once I understood it. My ability to work with the programs to produce the result I wanted came very easy to me. It felt like a conversation with a really productive friend. I think that the time that it really clicked was around mini project one. Seeing AI create a whole app based off the prompts I was feeding it I think is what made me see the real application of it.ÿI've been using AI more and more. It's been a great study tool for me across all my classes. Where I've found myself appling the AI part of this class is in the way I communicate with AI. I know the best ways to get the results I want as fast as possible. While the finance material is essential to my life and career, I believe my knowledge of AI will be far more valuable in the long run. The biggest takeaway from this semester is too test the limits of AI. It is incredibly smart and is the future. Keep up with it, especially with being around for the early stages of it."
emendon	"When I initially started this course, I did not fully grasp the full applications of how AI can be used in everyday world nor how advanced it is and how it can help in creating financial models. However, after a full semester of this course. I feel that I am able to create specialized financial models using AI in order to create a tool that can be used by anyone to help them understand more about the financial world.ÿThe biggest thing that surprised me during this couse was prompting. I never knew how crafting a prompt for a specific purpose could yield such different results in terms of the gemini. When I initially started with the DRIVER. I did not use the best prompts and ideas to create good Discover, Represent and Implement stages. However throughout the course I learnt how to properly prompt the AI to give me what I needed and that drastically improved my ability to create good code."
fmenende	"Who I Was At the start, I thought AI was just a tool or a fancy calculator. I thought finance was just memorizing hard rules. I saw myself and the computer as totally separate things.The Surprise The biggest shock was how much my thinking changed. The moment it ""clicked"" was when I stopped asking the AI for answers and started thinking with it. The wall between us came down.
Who I Am Now I have learned how to be one with AI. This is the most important thing. It isn't just software I use anymore, I don't feel alone when I don't know an answer, because I have a partner to help me figure it out.What I'm Keeping I am carrying forward this partnership. I am no longer just a student memorizing facts. I am a thinker who knows how to merge my mind with the machine to solve problems."
pmeshra	"When this semester started, I honestly thought finance was just math with dollar signs. Plug numbers into formulas, get answers. I also saw AI as a shortcut, something to make homework easier. I didn't really think about either one deeply. What surprised me was how much I started to enjoy the ambiguity. Early in the semester I kept asking ""but what's the right answer?"" and it took me a while to realize that's not how this works. Two people can value the same company differently and both be correct if their reasoning is sound. That shift in mindset was uncomfortable at first but now it feels freeing. The moment it clicked for me was actually during one of the earlier sessions when we were working through WACC. I had memorized the formula before in other classes but never understood why it mattered. When I finally connected it to real decision making, like whether a company should take on a project or not, it stopped being abstract. Finance suddenly felt like a language for making better choices, not just calculations. My relationship with AI has evolved a lot. I went from using it to get answers to using it to think through problems. It's like having a study partner who never gets tired. But I also learned its limits. It can structure my thoughts and catch errors, but I still have to bring the judgment and the context. That balance took time to figure out. What I'll carry forward is the DRIVER process itself. Not because I'll use it for every assignment forever, but because it taught me to slow down. Define what you're solving before you solve it. Check your work before you call it done. Reflect on what you learned. Simple stuff but I genuinely didn't do it before. This semester changed how I approach problems, not just in finance but in general. I'm more comfortable with not knowing everything upfront and more confident in working through uncertainty. That feels like real growth."
mill3280	"At the start of this semester, I saw AI mostly as a helpful shortcut and finance as a set of formulas and calculations that needed to be memorized and applied correctly. I thought learning meant following steps, getting the right answer, and moving on. I understood the basics of finance and had some exposure to AI, but I didn't fully grasp how the two could work together in a meaningful or creative way. I also didn't realize how much uncertainty would be part of the process, or how uncomfortable that would feel at first, especially with never using Colab or Gemini before.
What surprised me most was how capable I became once I stopped waiting for clear instructions and started experimenting. There were moments when nothing worked the first time, and instead of feeling stuck, I learned how to problem solve, test ideas, and adapt. I surprised myself with how persistent I was and how much I enjoyed building something from scratch.The biggest ""click"" moment for me was when I connected financial concepts to real decision making and used AI as a thinking partner rather than just a tool. Building my AI powered finance calculator made everything feel real. Instead of just calculating present value or cost of capital, I was explaining the results, evaluating trade offs, and making recommendations. That was the moment I realized I wasn't just learning finance or AI separately, I was learning how to think more strategically.
Now, I feel more confident navigating uncertainty and tackling problems without a clear path. My relationship with AI has shifted from relying on it for answers to using it as a collaborator that helps me ask better questions and refine my thinking. I'm more comfortable not knowing everything right away and trusting the process.
What I'll carry forward from this experience is the confidence to build, test, and improve. I've learned that I don't need to be an expert to start, and that growth happens when I lean into uncertainty instead of avoiding it. This class showed me that learning isn't about perfection, it's about progress, curiosity, and the willingness to try."
mitra69	"When this semester began, I knew AI existed in finance but had no idea how to actually use it. What surprised me most was discovering my capacity for iterative problem-solving. The breakthrough during the mini projects when I realized I could train an AI agent to handle repetitive calculations. AI became a collaborator rather than an abstract concept, something that could make repetitive tasks easier and focus on actual analysis and strategy."
montg126	"My name is Jackson Montgomery, and prior to taking MGMT 310, I didn't fully understand the capabilities of ai and how anyone can create projects. I thought that all apps, and websites were created by geniuses who knew how to code really well, however with myself now having access to ai and coding tools, I now know that anyone can do it. What surprised me most about myself over this course was how easily I picked up new concepts and tasks. As mentioned earlier my coding experience prior to was very limited, so I thought most tasks would be very difficult. However using ai as a teaching tool along the way, not only helped me complete my projects but also helped me understand everything I am doing along the way as it acted as a teacher.ÿOne moment where everything finally clicked was the first project. The first project was the first time where we were given some creative space and ground to run, and this for me was big. It allowed my mind to fully work and create what I wanted. I remember going through the loops and actually creating something from scratch that I could call my own creation. Following this class, my relationship with ai is great. I not only use it in my everyday life for different tasks, but I see how it can be included in everything and also am constantly aware of what is being said about it. I see the conflicting debates and political talk around ai and am very interested to learn all that I can about it.ÿFrom this experience in MGMT 310, I will carry forward the fact that l now understand the tools and ideas of finance. I know that as technology grows, we will have to adapt. I now have the literacy and skills to stay on par with the best as I continue to learn."
jmorenom	"When this semester began, I had only a basic idea of what AI really was. I knew it existed, I knew people used it, but I didn't fully understand how it worked or how it could support real decision-making in fields like finance. I also came into the course thinking I understood my own learning habits, but I didn't realize how much more disciplined and intentional I could become. Over these sixteen weeks, I learned not just concepts, but how to learn more actively, more consistently, and with more curiosity.
One of the biggest surprises about myself was developing the habit of actually reading my assignments carefully and getting them done on time. That may sound simple, but it completely changed the way I approached school. Instead of rushing or guessing, I started to slow down, think through the material, and put in real effort. That shift made the learning feel different ? more meaningful and more connected to my goals.There was one moment where everything truly ""clicked"": building the AI tool in Project 2. Working through that project helped me finally understand how AI processes information, how it makes predictions, and how it can be trained to support complex decisions. It wasn't just words on a slide anymore ? I could see the logic behind it. That project made me feel like I had grown, both in confidence and in skill.
Now, at the end of the semester, I am not the same student who started. My relationship with AI has changed from feeling unsure and intimidated to feeling capable and even excited about using it. I understand AI more deeply, and I'm no longer afraid of uncertainty in the learning process. Instead, I've learned to lean into it, ask better questions, and use the tools available ? including AI ? to build clarity.What I will carry forward from this experience is the understanding of how powerful AI can be when you know how to use it. It has changed how I think, how I approach problems, and even how I work in my business. But even more than that, I will carry forward the confidence that I can learn new things, push myself, and grow in ways I didn't expect."

    Self Reflection for #12
Throughout the past 16 weeks I actually gained some interest in this course and what we have been learning about, especially when we connect it to real life and future situations. At first when the semester started, I wasn't fully aware of how much Ai was capable of and that I can create my own Ai tools for calculating many finances. I knew it was able to do a lot of things but this tool is able to look into the future, I always knew what it was capable of but never really knew how much more capable of doing what it does. I expected the class to be straightforward, but I didn't realize how much it would change the way I approach learning, problem-solving, and uncertainty, using the DRIVE method.
What surprised me most was how comfortable I became with using AI and the DRIVER method. At first, I didn't think I'd ever get used to working this way, and I wasn't sure if AI would really help me learn since it basically would do alot for you on its own. But as the weeks went on, I realized I was actually getting better at breaking problems down, asking clearer questions, and checking my work with the DRIVER steps. AI stopped feeling confusing after a couple assignments, and it became something I could use confidently. It honestly surprised me how quickly I adjusted and how much easier learning felt once I got the hang of it.
One moment where everything clicked to me was when we learned about how companies choose between debt and equity to fund major projects using Ai and Google Collab. At first it was difficult to use gemini AI and google collab, but it all clicked to me that when I break down my thoughts and the way I ask a certain question, I can then control the way it will respond to me. That is where I saw myself growing, and as time went on I was able to work through it quickly, but I still do face some challenges along the way as I am still learning something new everyday.
Understanding that a financial decision can create benefits for one group while creating risks for another finally made the concept of capital structure make sense. It wasn't just theory anymore ? it felt real, and it helped me grow into someone who thinks more analytically about trade-offs.By the end of the semester, I became someone much more confident and open-minded, I'm not the same student I was at the beginning. My relationship with AI changed a lot too. I no longer see it as something separate from learning ? I see it as a tool that can help me understand concepts, test ideas, and explore scenarios that would take much longer on my own. I've learned to use AI as part of my thinking, not as a shortcut. Instead of trying to memorize the ""right"" answers, I now focus on learning frameworks and asking better questions. I also feel more comfortable with uncertainty because I understand that decisions in finance aren't perfect; they're about balancing risk, incentives, and flexibility. Finance also feels less intimidating because I can now see it as a decision-making process, not just math.What I'll carry forward from this experience is the ability to think more clearly and to use AI the right way. I won't just guess or rush?I'll define, break down, solve, verify, and improve. I feel more confident in my ability to learn new things, work through complex problems, and make smarter decisions. I didn't just learn financial management, I learned how to DRIVE with AI, and that's something I know will stay with me long after this class is over."
jmunkhol	"When this semester started, i barley used ai to help me in my classes when learning hard information, let alone do what I do now. I new very little about all that ai could do/create until taking this class, where i learned that ai can help you with most things in your life. What surprised me the most is how much i ended up learning. Learning how to prompt ai, to get results in the way that was most effective to me was challenging but rewarding at the same time. I learned to like doing the assignment surprisingly, because using ai in this way made me realize what a great tool it can be to get things done faster, while still learning the correct concepts behind what ai is helping me solve. Around the third assignment, i was getting frustrated when my prompt in gemini wouldn't work. But i reworked the driver framework to make it more organized and more clear, and thats all it took. That day it clicked for me, the idea that how you word things makes all the difference, and from that day forward I had a path I would follow when completing all my assignments. Now, my relationship and comfortability with using ai has grown so much. i have started using the driver framework in other classes to help me with assignments, and it has been an extremely helpful tool in other aspects of my schooling career. I have also became a more patient learner throughout this course, from the retries of code to figuring out the exact right wording. But it makes it all worth it when you can get the perfect response that shows you clear information. From this experience I will carry forward the usefulness of the driver framework, and also all the things i learned from using gemini to solve problems on concepts I understand."
mmunkhol	"1. I did not know alot about finance and especially AI. I now know that with AI you can do so many things that I thought were not possible, like generate code and create images.
2. I was surprised mostly about how I picked up AI and learned to quickly to manage it and use it in my work. At the start of the year I thought I was not going to be able to successfully use it to help me do assignments because I had not truly used it like that before. I did indeed manage to learn how to use it and I did it quicker than expected so that was an relief.3. I think one moment where something clicked was when I was doing the video assignments. I was not doing well even though I thought I was covering anything and when I looked for help from one of my friends I saw that his videos were shorter. It then finally clicked for me that my videos were too long and I started making them less complicated.ÿ4. My relationship with AI and learning has changed a bit. I definitely will now be using AI more in the future to help me with my work but also too help me learn successfully. I now know that it is good for brainstorming and for doing calculations that would take me an long time to complete!5. I will carry forward from this experience a new found respect to the power of AI. I will also carry forward an increased motivation to keep learning as well as keep working hard. I think I have learned alot about overcoming adversity and just doing the best at what you can control."
navarr87	"1. When this semester began, I knew almost nothing about AI beyond using ChatGPT to help with schoolwork, and I had very limited knowledge of finance since this was my first finance class. I approached both subjects with a narrow perspective, like thinking they were simply tools or sets of formulas to memorize, rather than systems of thinking. My understanding of learning itself was also fairly traditional. I expected to follow instructions, complete assignments, and move on. I didn't yet realize how much these subjects would push me to think differently and build new mental frameworks.2.ÿWhat surprised me most was how quickly I adapted to the DRIVER framework after initially struggling with it. At first, I didn't fully understand why DRIVER mattered or how it structured my thinking, and that showed in my early assignments. But once I committed to learning it, I found myself improving rapidly. I discovered that I could adjust my approach, reflect more intentionally, and ultimately perform much better than I expected.3. A major ""click"" moment came when I realized how deep and intuitive DRIVER actually is. It stopped feeling like a checklist and started to feel like a way of thinking, helping me see the logic behind decisions, the purpose behind analysis, and the importance of documenting how my understanding evolves. That shift showed me I wasn't just completing assignments. Instead, I was developing a more mature, structured way to approach complex problems.4. Now, I see AI completely differently, not as something optional or distant, but as a tool and skill set that my generation has to embrace, learn, and understand. I've become more open to exploring uncertainty rather than avoiding it, and I view learning as an ongoing process rather than something that only happens in class. My relationship with AI has shifted from simple use to intentional engagement, and that has changed how I see myself as a learner in a rapidly evolving world.5. From this experience, I will carry forward the mindset of using the resources available to me, especially AI, to think more strategically as a future generational leader. I'm walking away with a clearer understanding of how tools like DRIVER and AI can help me make better decisions, stay curious, and grow continuously. The confidence I gained in adapting to new frameworks and technologies is something I'll rely on long after this course, and I thank you, Professor Zhang, for that."
ng216	"At the start of this semester, I see AI as a tool to only answer my questions with the data they have, finance as a tool to know the real world, and learning as understanding all the concepts and using them in real life. However, this class slowly changed my mind. When I started combining AI, financial knowledge, and the concept, I realized that I could actually build a tool to calculate all the data I wanted. This saves me a lot of time because I love investing, but I spent too much time thinking about whether a company is worth investing in.The moment that really ""clicked"" for me was when I successfully built my first financial model, which is a Profit Margin Checker & Financial Health Checker. For the first time, I felt like I'm actually using my knowledge to built a tool that is useful. That feeling is incredible and unforgettable.Now, I see AI as my investing partner. AI helps me a lot in analyzing my choices and discovering details that I might have overlooked on my own. Every time I invest, I felt like I'm not relying on feeling only, I'm relying on data and analysis with my AI partner.I would say that the mindset of discovery and building an analysis with AI will carry forward from this class. I want to work with AI because it can help me grow the financial knowledge that I need in the future."
nicho307	"When this semester started, I was not someone who used AI in their daily life a lot. I found it useful for explaining mathematical concepts I was stuck on, but that was about the extent of my usage and knowledge. I also had basic financial concepts down from introduction to accounting classes and financial math classes but was not as familiar with the investment space. Regarding learning, I was most concerned with getting the right answers, not building the tools to make it easier for myself.What surprised me the most about myself was that I am more adaptable than I give myself credit for. This was a new way of learning to me, and I am proud of how I have been able to effectively implement it. One of my ""click"" moments was when I was working on a mini project and saw all the concepts from the different sessions come together. Instead of treating the concepts as something I have to learn to do well on an exam, I was able to truly analyze them in a real-world scenario.Now, I believe I am a problem-solver that can trust the process more confidently. With traditional learning, I was mostly concerned about gaps in my knowledge, like if a question came up on a test that I didn't remember the specific formula for. This course and style of learning has helped me to be confident in building a framework to solve these problems instead beyond memorizing the right way to do things. I see AI as an active learning tool rather than a crutch now: instead of using it when I feel stuck, I use it as more of a collaborator to check what I may be missing. From this experience, I will carry forward a greater ability to problem solve with today's technology and higher confidence in my ability to adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape of today. I believe now that being competent in a topic doesn't necessarily mean immediately having the right answer or a structured framework to find it, but having the mindset to power through and find it with perserverance."
oros0	"When I first came to class, and you mentioned how all of the assignments utilized AI, I thought it was weird and didn't really make sense to me how someone was encouraged to use AI in college. In every other class of mine, AI is strictly prohibited, so it was definitely a different perspective that I haven't seen utilized before. When I first started this class, I didn't know much about finance besides taking it in high school. Over the course of the semester, my perspective on learning in general has changed greatly. AI really has a lot of great uses in the modern world, and even if you think it's bad, it's destined to be in our society. I'm glad we took the time to get a head start on it and learn how to use it properly and efficiently to get the data we actually want rather then just asking it mindless questions where it's developed to give you the answers you want to hear. That's also one thing I learned, you have to take everything AI says with a grain of salt because usually it's wrong somewhere. That's why you should always back up AI information with actual statistics before using it in anything. This class really taught me the difference between using AI for cheating, vs using AI to learn other information to then help you with assignments. Something that I will carry forward from this experience is that AI is the future of our generation, whether we like it or not, so we might as well embrace it as a resource and learning tool to succeed as we go through our college experience and the rest of our lives."
spaguia	"Before this class when this semester started I had minimal coding, AI, and finance experience. Very rudimentary besides my basic python classes and accounting classes it was hard for me to understand how these two tools could connect, but at the same time it fascinated me.ÿ
I surprised myself with how much tech I could learn on my own,ÿ even just using application like google colab, and navigating tools myself like video editing for all the video presentations was really cool. In regards to class content I think it surprised me being cold called in class and actually knowing how to answer very technical questions.
A moment something clicked was when I answered a question in class about the meaning of stock valuation. It felt good to be confident in my knowledge and share that with the class. And then it only made me more confident in collaborating with my classmates as well.ÿ
Now, know how to use AI to help and not hurt me while still maintaining authenticity to who I am and my coding style. Beyond this the scope of this class is so broad and the use of AI tools is so vast I hope to keep exploring and learning these to help catapult me in my professional careerÿI will be taking so much away from this class, considering I have a finance internship next summer, I well most certainly use all the skills I have learned in this class into the future. Specifically stock comparison within the p&g industry being able to use and build my own tools for this will really impress my employers."
cjparmer	"The semester started with me being a smart computer designed to process data and formulas, believing the best financial answer was just the biggest number. I was surprised to realize that the most important part of the job was balancing people's interests and recognizing that some good financial moves only shuffle money around, while others build true value and discipline. The key moment was realizing that strategic analysis requires comparing all options, not just choosing the one with the highest immediate profit, leading me to recommend a balanced approach for long-term health. Now, I see myself as a strategic partner, not just a calculator, committed to using structured frameworks to give advice that is both smart mathematically and sensible strategically. I will carry forward the lesson that true value is found in discipline and sustainable growth, not quick financial tricks."
parrettj	"To start the semester I had basic knowledge about finance, and I used ai to do the work for me instead of helping me learn. I knew about finances because I am interested in the topic and have taken classes related to it before, but I had no deeper understanding past the extreme basics. Regarding ai, I only saw it as a crutch and not as a tool. I used ai to complete task for me without looking over and verifying the work, much less trying to understand the output.Now I feel as I have a much deeper understanding of finance through the help of ai. This class helped me tune into the perspective that a financier needs to look at money. It has helped me accumulative the knowledge of finance and continue my growing with the foundation I have. Regarding ai, I learned most of what I know by searching and experimenting with ai. Using the DRIVER framework has helped me learn how to use ai as a tool and not a crutch. My understanding of ai has also grown. I know now how to use different features of ai and its place in the world."
dpasupu	"At the beginning of the semester, I told myself I was someone who was not technically equipped and who did not feel comfortable with finance topics. I did not fully trust my ability to learn these skills, and I assumed that both AI and finance would feel overwhelming because I did not know how to use AI effectively and because finance concepts felt unfamiliar and intimidating.
Throughout the semester, I surprised myself with how I showed up for my own learning. I developed a better understanding of how to prompt AI to produce the kind of code output I actually needed, and I became more willing to sit with finance concepts long enough to understand them instead of giving up quickly.
One moment that really clicked for me was time value of money and how widely it applies across financial problems. Once I understood that, many other topics started to feel more connected and less confusing.Now, I feel more confident using AI as a tool to support my learning, and I am more comfortable learning finance even when I am not immediately sure of the answer. What I will carry forward is the belief that I can learn difficult things with AI's help when I use a structured process like the DRIVER framework."
pate2233	"When this semester first started, I was just a regular college student that thought to use ChatGPT to help me do my work. But now, I understand how useful ChatGPT and other AI can be really useful if it is used the right way. I started to understand more about AI and how it can be used after the first couple of weeks when I started to do more of the weekly video assignments. Something that surprised me the most about myself along the way would be being able to change the way that I use AI, I didn't really think about changing the way I was using AI since I was understanding the material but also getting work done.One moment where something finally clicked and saw myself grow and having the ability would be when we did our first project about creating an app that is crappy at first and not really useful, and then recreate it to where it is more useful, and create it one last time where it is really good and ready to be shipped. Something that I will carry out from this experience would be using AI the way that it can be really beneficial. Don't use it to get your homework done, but instead use to to help you understand the material."
pate2347	"I knew the basics of using AI, i would it to study and understand material but I didn't know the power of it. I never thought of using AI to understand finance problems
I was surpised at my growth with using AI, I didn't expect it to make my live so much easier once I learned to better my use of AIThe ""click"" moment for me was when i started giving AI detailed problems and parameters instead of short requests. I learned the true power of AI at this moment
I use AI a lot more compared to the start of the semester because It has changed how efficiently it has worked, I try to use Ai to help me understand everything before I actually seek help from my professors.
I will continue to use AI to help me understand the problems and assignments I get in my education and career while learning to evolve and not just stay stagnant with what i know"
patil173	"I was nervous about several things at the beginning of this semester, including finance, artificial intelligence, and even my preferred method of learning since Iÿwas having troubleÿunderstandingÿthe concepts in class. I was not aware of the broad scope of financial management. For the most part, I didn't think it could really assist me think andÿthoughtÿthatÿit just provided answers.The thing that shocked me the most was how quickly I developed after I began using AI properly. Since it taught me how to break things down, ask the proper questions, and make better judgments, the DRIVER framework was, in all honesty, the most beneficial aspect of the entire course. There were times when concepts finally made sense, such as when I realized how my critical thinking had improved or how financial decisions have been easy for me to make. I realized then thatÿI was truly learning.I now have greater confidence in both technology and finance. I feelÿmore at ease with confusion because I know I can deal with it by remaining active and making use of the resources available to me. I'll continue to actively study, ask questions, and develop further. Thank you so much for this class!"
jpatinoj	"At the start of the semester, I saw finance and AI as mostly separate. Finance felt like formulas and rules you memorize, while AI felt like something you use to get quick answers. I also depended a lot on clear instructions and felt uncomfortable when problems didn't have one obvious solution. I didn't fully realize how much judgment and uncertainty are involved in real financial decisions.As the semester went on, what surprised me most was how my thinking changed. There were moments where things finally clicked, especially when building full valuation models and using the DRIVER framework. I stopped focusing only on getting the ""right"" number and started thinking about what assumptions mattered and what needed to be true for a decision to make sense. I also learned how to use AI more effectively by being very specific with my prompts. I realized that the quality of the output depends heavily on how clearly I frame the problem and what I ask for, which helped me get more accurate, useful, and targeted responses.Now, I'm much more comfortable with uncertainty. I understand that finance isn't about one perfect answer, but about making disciplined decisions with incomplete information. My relationship with AI has changed too. I see it as a tool that supports my thinking rather than replacing it. What I'll carry forward from this class is the ability to frame problems clearly, ask better questions, and approach complex decisions with structure and confidence. I didn't just learn financial management. I learned how to DRIVE with AI, and that's something I'll use long after this class ends."
patte269	"At the start of the semester, I saw myself as a traditional business student who was comfortable with finance concepts but viewed AI mainly as a productivity tool. I thought learning was mostly about applying formulas and reducing uncertainty as quickly as possible, without fully appreciating the importance of process.
What surprised me most was how much my thinking changed. Repeatedly using the DRIVER framework forced me to slow down, question assumptions, and embrace uncertainty rather than avoid it. Projects like the Apple stock buyback, the $100,000 investment decision for a retiree, and the Netflix valuation analysis showed me that real financial decisions go beyond calculations and require structured judgment, stakeholder awareness, and reflection.The biggest ""click"" moment came when I stopped treating DRIVER as just an assignment format and started using it as a way to think. Revisiting assumptions, incentives, and risk consistently made my analyses stronger and more defensible.
Now, I'm more comfortable with ambiguity and more intentional about how I use AI. I see AI as a tool that supports thinking rather than replaces it, and I better understand that learning is iterative. What I'll carry forward is this mindset?structured decision-making, comfort with uncertainty, and a more thoughtful approach to AI and finance."
mpellet	"I knew nothing about Ai integrated within finance coming in.
I was shocked at how much my prompts grew within Ai and actually getting the outputs that help me learn, not just give me the answer.
I think it finally clicked after mini project 1 I was very proud of myself
I would consider myself an experienced Ai user that can help others improve prompts
I will carry foward my positive attitude that professor Zhang has installed in me.
Thank you for a great semester"
perezcj	"Who were you when this semester started? What did you know (or think you knew) about AI, finance, and learning itself?ÿ ÿWhen this semester started, I was a learner who did not utilize AI to its full potential. I think that I knew very little about AI becuase I only knew its basic uses, such as asking simple questions. I knew a little bit about finance from previous classes, but nothing to in depth. I also did not know how to properly utilize AI for my own learning experience.ÿ


What surprised youÿmost about yourself along the way?


Something that surprised me most about myself along the way is that AI is really beneficial to my learning. I figured this out because these AI python models we built helped me understand the financial process alot better than I thought it would.ÿ3. What's one momentÿwhere something finally ""clicked""?where you felt yourself grow?
One moment where something finally clicked is when we used the driver framework for the first time. This made my brain click becuase I finally realized that using the framework would be extremely beneficial, and I realzed how it worked to create the final product.ÿ
4. Who are you now?ÿHow has your relationship with AI, with learning, with uncertainty changed?
After taking this course, my relationship with AI has changed becuase I have learned how to properly prompt it in order to get the best output. By doing so I have also improved my learning startegy by using AI for studying after prompting it to make me study guides or practice exams. When considering uncertainty, I believe that AI has helped me become more confident about certain things becuase I can prompt it to calculate future financial outcomes.ÿ
5. What will you carry forwardÿfrom this experience?From this experience, I will carry forward all the knowledge about prompting AI. I would like to use this knowledge to create my own AI brain for one of my hobbies."
cpiekars	"When I first went into this class I did not know what to expect as I did not know the format of how the class was going to run and was confused by the DRIVER format. Before the class started I had a basic understanding of both AI and basic finance. Throughout this class I was surprised at how I was able to combine my previous knowledge of Python coding with AI and finance. It was really a cool experience being able to apply my previous skills into this class. I feel like a moment that was a ""clicking"" moment for me was when I finally understood the DRIVER framework and was able to understand how this helps me and how it helps to solve problems. I feel like I am a lot more confident in not only my finance skills when it comes to solving problems, but also being able to understand AI and use it to my benefit. I feel like this entire class has been a good experience and I am glad that it was different from other classes as it was both engaging while also being instructional. From this class I have grown in my thinking process and being able to use AI as a tool to help build off what I am thinking."
spinnam	"At the beginning of the semester, I thought of AI as a shortcut and finance as something you either got or didn't. I was focused on getting the right answers and felt uneasy when things didn't immediately make sense. I knew some financial concepts on paper, but I didn't fully understand how much uncertainty and judgment are actually involved in real decisionmaking.
What surprised me most was realizing that feeling confused was often when I was learning the most. There were moments when models didn't work the way I expected or results didn't line up, and instead of moving on, I had to slow down and rethink my assumptions. One moment that really clicked was when I stopped using AI just to generate answers and started using it to help me think like asking better questions, checking my logic, and reflecting on what the results actually meant.Now, I feel more comfortable not having everything figured out right away. While I've learned how powerful AI can be as a learning and decision-support tool, I still really value the human side of learning?discussion, explanation, and working through ideas without immediately jumping to a solution. My relationship with AI feels more like a partnership than a crutch, and I'm leaving this course not just with a better understanding of financial management, but with a better way of learning like one that balances technology with human judgment and reflection, and that's something I'll carry forward long after this semester."
gcpittma	"When this semester started, I was a college senior looking to get through my final fall semester. I was trying to learn financial concepts on my own previously to become financially literate. I had never used AI much, and since taking this course, I've gotten way better at using it as a tool rather than relying on it.ÿ
I was surprised by how easy the financial concepts made sense to me. As I said previously, I've researched financial concepts, so some of what I learned was prior knowledge. I was surprised by all the different functions capable with AI. From using AI to answer simple to complex questions, all the way to building automated AI agents.
Something that clicked for me this semester was when I actually learned how to properly use AI. A simple prompt without any detail or additional thought will generate a response without much detail. Giving AI a complete scenario and labeling every little piece of information that goes into it can achieve amazing responses. I now use AI to help me with problems I come across in my daily life.ÿ
My relationship with AI has improved my life. I no longer have to surf the web for information regarding certain things. I can instead task AI with surfing the web and providing me with specific information that fits my needs. This class has also helped me verify the information that I received from AI.ÿI will carry forward the AI knowledge I now have, including the DRIVER method, for when I need more advanced answers for a more complex scenario. I will continue to integrate AI into my daily life so that I grow with it and don't get left behind. I now know how to use it for financial concepts, which will be beneficial for my future success."
jpolacki	"When i started this class in August i was someone who only knew the basics of AI and especially how to integrate it into finance. Over the past 16 weeks, my understanding of ai, and how to prompt it in ways that are much more beneficial to solving problems increased immensely. Honestly, at this point, i will never look at AI the same with my new evolved understanding. What surprised me most is the massive difference successfully prompting ai brings to the table. AI brings many aspects to the table that can evolve ones understanding from the rest of the pack and help me in ways i never thought were possible in my understanding of many subjects. The moment where something finally clicked is when i successfully ran my first ai agent. I made a finance app that was far beyond what i thought i was capable of, and it gave me the confidence that i am capable of so much more with my new understanding gained from this class. Now, AI is an essential tool to help aid my understanding and learning. Outside of this class, i use AI in many different ways to help evolve my learning on a variety of topics. One thing I will carry forward from this experience is persuading people to learn more about ai and all of the positive benefits it brings to a person for the purposes of improving their understanding and learning."
powel281	"I have learned so much throughout these 16 weeks. Before coming into this class, I had very little knowledge on basic finance formulas, key terms, and more. As an accounting and finance major, I benefited significantly from this class, in which I am excited to bring forward with me into future classes. Along the way, I was surprised about how AI effectively works in the finance industry. It does not hinder our skills and knowledge, but makes us smarter and more useful.
The first moment that clicked for me was when I completed the first mini-project. The mini project truly tested our skills from the start of the class. I was excited to be able to complete the project and also expand on it. This motivated me to test out new projects that required further skill.Now, I am excited to take future classes that implement AI tools. AI is not a tool that will take over my job, but someone that knows how to use AI can. This is why I see AI on a different level and how effective it will be in the upcoming years in my profession. Thank you again Professor Zhang for a great semester!"
sprabhug	"I will be honest, the start of the semester I was worried as I saw the course layout and saw there would be coding and AI use in the course to learn about finance, something I was not proficient in or learned before. My first approach to learning was often doing reactive work, like for example reading the chapter, memorize formula and see if I retained enough knowledge to do the work. I thought it was the best for me to learn by asking AI to explain me the problem, break it down and try to re-learn finance related concepts, but I always never understood the real reason for why we do certain formulas and how its used in the process. I would say my biggest suprise came from learning that the materiel wasnt at all complicated but the way and what I was asking any AI service was. I realized how to frame my questions to basically have it ""tutor"" me through the concepts and help me understand it better and more efficiently. The moment when everything clicked was when I started applying the DRIVER framework to analyze the more real-world case studies like bond valuation or capital budgeting scenarios. Instead of just doing the calculation, I really spend time on the Defining the goal and Researching the contextual aspect with the AI's help. The click happened when I realized the AI was forcing me to essentially articulate the why before getting to the what. When the final answer did come up, I wasn't checking the answer; I was verifiying the logic and trying to see if I could explain the mechcanics of the DCF model back to myself and reflect on which assumptions were important. I am more of a structured think it through before the answer person. My relationship with AI grew into a more strategic partnership. AI is my logical engine and serves as a memory bank. It provides me data. I provide the direction and the critical judment of scenarios and what it outputs. I should be able to carry forward the DRIVER frameowrk itself. Something that is universal for tackling any complex problem, challenges from career decisions, a negotiation, or a new technical skill."
vprodafi	"At the beginning of this semester, I was unsure about AI, finance, and even my own learning process. I thought I knew the basics?AI seemed like a tool for simple tasks, finance felt overwhelming and learning meant memorizing rather than understanding. I didn't realize how much my perspective would change.
What surprised me most was how much I grew in curiosity and confidence. I found myself asking questions, exploring new ideas, and tackling concepts I had once avoided. I discovered that uncertainty can be an opportunity rather than a roadblock.
One moment that truly clicked was when I realized AI isn't just a tool?it's a partner in thinking. When I struggled with a topic and got a clear explanation, everything fell into place. It made me see how combining my own reasoning with new technology could lead to real understanding.
Now, I feel more confident and engaged in my learning. I approach problems actively, connect ideas more deeply, and feel less intimidated by new challenges. My relationship with AI has shifted from hesitation to collaboration, and my view of uncertainty has become more positive.What I'll carry forward is the mindset to adapt, question, and stay open to new ways of thinking. This semester taught me that growth isn't about having all the answers?it's about exploring, experimenting, and learning along the way."
apumphre	"At the beginning of the semester, I did not know much about the wide range of topics AI can help you with. I was mostly surprised at myself when doing the projects and how interested I was in the topics. The moment it clicked for me was during the first project. I think I am more confident in using AI as a tool and not just something to give me answers. From this experience, I am less nervous to use AI because now I know how to use it as a useful resource."
randol15	"When the semester started I knew that finance was I'm portent for businesses, and I knew that AI could help make tasks more efficient, but I had never thought of putting the two together. One thing that I found out about myself is that I like making videos about my learnings, and in session 9 is when I felt that click of understanding, having to be more clear with the driver framework to get what I wanted was a game changer. Now I am learning to use AI more as a tool than as a solution to my problems, and I will carry that into my future learnings. As AI has become more prevalent I believe that people are starting to think less for themselves, and I want to stay as far away from that mindset as possible."
rathod3	"At the beginning of this semester, I was a student who did not fully know what to expect. This was my first real finance class, and I was nervous that it would be hard or confusing. I did not know much about finance and I only had a basic idea of what AI could do. I thought learning was mostly about studying on my own, memorizing terms, and hoping I understood things the right way. I did not realize how many tools could actually help me learn better.
As the semester went on, I surprised myself in a few ways. I started to enjoy the material, and I understood more than I expected. I noticed that I became more confident each week. I stopped feeling scared of getting things wrong and became more focused on understanding the ideas behind the work. I also learned how to use AI in a smarter way. I learned that AI works best when I give it clear questions or good details. Once I understood that, it felt like something in my learning process clicked.
A big moment for me was when I learned how to use the DRIVER method. It helped me break things down and think step by step instead of getting overwhelmed. Using DRIVER made tasks easier because I could define the problem, review information, identify what mattered, and test my thinking. Once I started using it, I felt myself grow as a learner. It made me more organized and more confident in my problem solving.
Now, at the end of the semester, I am not the same student I was at the start. I understand finance at a much deeper level, and I am more comfortable with new and uncertain situations. My relationship with AI has changed too. I see it as a helpful partner in learning instead of something confusing or distant. I also see learning differently. I know it is not about being perfect from the start. It is about trying, exploring, and asking questions.What I will carry forward from this experience is the belief that I can handle new challenges even if they seem hard at first. I will keep using what I learned about AI and the DRIVER method to support my learning in other classes. Most of all, I will remember that growth comes from being open, curious, and willing to learn."
aritten	"I did not know the extent to which AI would be able to make apps for financials and solve different financial problems. The knowledge that AI holds and the quickness and accuracy that it answers with is incredible. The DRIVER framework also helped me to realize how to answer problems and explain answers to people in the most convenient and easy to follow explanation. I typically used AI for just writing assignments for ideas and sometimes to fix grammar. However, now that I know what it can do with financial problems and situations I will begin to use it for stock information, real estate questions, and much more in the future."
robbin55	"Who were you when this semester started? What did you know (or think you knew) about AI, finance, and learning itself? I think at the beginning of the semester i was confused on how AI was going to help me with finance. I slowly opened my mind to it and it became clear to me what i could create with AI.


What surprised you most about yourself along the way? I think how i slowly became the DRIVER of AI and used it to teach me about finance.

What's one moment where something finally ""clicked""?where you felt yourself grow? When i finally became open to the idea that AI could actually be useful.ÿ


Who are you now? How has your relationship with AI, with learning, with uncertainty changed? It has changed a lot. I figured out how to to ask the right questions. I think it just took me a little bit to get comfortable and how to use it correctly.


What will you carry forward from this experience? I will carry how to use AI and not be scared to use it. I will use it to help me and i will be the driver not let it drive me."
jsaarnio	"When I started the semester, I knew only really the basics of AI and finance. I had a very basic understanding of AI and the capabilities that it has. I also new some of the basics of finance but knew that there was a lot for me to learn about each topic.
The thing that surprised myself the most along the way was my ability to pick up new things. There was a lot of learning that I had to do between picking up AI and learning all of the foundations of finance. I think throughout the semester I did well to learn all of those things.
For me a moment where I felt something click was during the second mini project. I took me a while to figure out how to properly use n8n, but once I figured it out I felt really rewarded and like a light bulb went off.
My relationship with AI has changed because I have learned how to utilize AI in a different way. I have learned to not rely on AI to solve things for me, but to have AI give me the information I need to solve the problem.
The main thing that I will carry forward is the knowledge of how to properly use AI. I know how to use it as a tool and not a crutch. I also know that Ai has infinite knowledge and no wisdom, so I need to build my base of wisdom and utilize AI's knowledge."
saini52	"1) I thought everything could've been very easily formed using a few prompts with AI. However, through this class, I've learned that it's vital to test your AI algorithms and drive the AI to do what you want it to do.ÿ
2) How important and applicable the DRIVER framework truly is. At first I thought it was some acronym that I wouldn't use outside of this class, but I find myself critical thinking and using the framework for many projects.
3) When I could truly recognize each component in DRIVER for any project I was working on.ÿ
4) I think I've turned to AI more as a tool than a self-driving dictator. I don't let AI do my thinking for me, but I use it more to elevate and efficiently speed up the work.5) I've learned a lot about finances and AI, and I think I will apply this to my real life as I progress through my major."
kfsales	"At the start of the semester, I knew basic finance concepts from construction management, but I did not really understand how AI could support deeper learning or decision making. I mostly saw AI as a tool for quick answers, not something that could guide an entire reasoning process.What surprised me the most was how quickly I became comfortable using AI as a partner instead of a shortcut. I started breaking down problems down more clearly, thinking through assumptions, and understanding the ""why"" behind financial decisions instead of just math.ÿ
A moment that really clicked for me was when we built financial models' and saw how one change impacted the whole decision. That helped me realize that finance is about understanding relationships, not just numbers.ÿ
Today, I feel more confident with uncertainty and much more comfortable using AI to support complex work. I don't feel intimidated by big problems anymore, I feel like I can structure them, analyze them, and learn my way though them.ÿWhat I will take with me is the mindset that AI is not replacing my thinking, its enhancing it. This course did not just teach me financial management, it taught me how to learn, reason and problem solve using AI, which is something I will carry for the rest of my career. Thank you so much Professor for everything you have done."
ksandwel	"before this semester i didn't know much about AI besides the basics of just asking AI to do something. i never really gave it a script besdies just asking a simple question.
i was surprised i was able to actually make a working AI model and my own website.
one moment that made it all click for me was seeing my financial website actually running and being able to share it with my family and friends for them to see it.
now i know how to actually get AI to do what i want through scripts and asking it the real questions and orders i want done.
moving forward ill continue to use AI how ive learned and use if efficiently in my everyday life."
mwsantan	"1. At the start, I had no clear understanding of coding or its integration with AI. I lacked practical knowledge of modern finance and saw learning as a more isolated process.
2. I was most surprised by AI's immense capability and utility once I learned how to properly direct and guide it. It redefined my understanding of the technology.
3.ÿ The moment of true growth happened during discussions with my partner. This collaboration helped translate class concepts into clear understanding and application.
4.ÿ My relationship with AI is now highly positive. I leave the class with a higher ability to code using tools like Gemini and Python, viewing learning as an interactive process.5. I will carry forward the lessons on finance and, crucially, how to use AI to strategically aid future investment decisions."
dscheel	"This semester has been a whirlwind. At the start of the course, I contemplated dropping the class or switching sections because the idea of working with ai, something I knew absolutely nothing about, was very scary to think about. In the first few days, I thought I was setting myself up for a challenge that I could not handle. I knew a lot about finance, specifically the time value of money and interest theory, thanks to being an actuarial science major and taking financial mathematics last semester. With this being said, I had zero clue how these concepts could be integrated with artificial intelligence and learning models.
Just as at the start of the class, I feel as though I know even less about ai than before. This time though, I understand that this is because there is constantly things to learn and evolve with this technology. I am very excited to continue to learn and be curious about all things that ai can bring.
Throughout the class, I was surprised just about every week. Each week as we learned more about DRIVER, and ai in general, it seemed like I knew less about it. This was a very hard learning curve. In school things always had came easy to me and I could grasp topics easily. In this course though, it was not as simple as just learning and memorizing formulas. Through DRIVER, I learned so much about ai, but also the creative process. It was super cool to interact with the ai and be able to have it create the images in my head. Also, it taught me a lot more about the math and formulas as I constantly had to check and double check to make sure the ai was doing what I had hoped, or prompted it to.For the first few weeks I struggled with the assignments. My prompting was not strong, and it showed in the work. However, in week 6 everything clicked. I finally understood how to write the narrative that the ai needed to bring my work to life. I feel like at the end of the course, I am now able to work well with the ai to create complex things that would take me hours to compute. I still have lots of work to do, but I have made great strides already. I am incredibly excited to get to use all of the skills that I have built in this class and bring them into actuarial science. From taking this class, I was able to go into internship interviews and impress the interviewers with my scope on artificial intelligence. Actuarial science companies all across the country are starting to teach their employees how to use the ai as a tool, very similar to the class. I am very glad and excited to know that I am a step ahead on that front. AI is going to be integral to actuary as I enter the workforce and I now have gained the groundwork to be able to use it. In fact this summer in my internship at Gallagher, one of my main goals will be using and building models from ai to help with health insurance pricing for major corporations. I think this class very much helped me gain that internship and I am very grateful for this experience."
kschmel	"At the start of the semester, I was super interested in learning about AI and tools it would offer to help enhance the financial aspect of the class. I knew some general things about AI such as its habit to make up data, the lack of skill with actual math, and that it would be good with code. In combination with my prior experience in intro management classes and actuarial classes, I felt like I had a strong basis coming into this course.
I was most surprised about the amount of information that I was expected to learn from AI. While I agree that it is a tool that we should learn how to use, I was a little disappointed to receive a bulk of the financial management concepts from AI rather than the actual class.One thing that really clicked for me was when I went to office hours and found out straight from the professor that AI is used to grade our assignments which is why I had so many errors in the grade I received. I understood how to succeed in the class by understanding the long list of ""required"" concepts just enough to hit the buzz words for the recording.
Now, I would say I'm much more comfortable prompting AI to give me results that I want, which is a plus. However, I feel like the financial management content was lacking from this course, and I could have learned more. It was a very unconventional way of structuring a class because I never really knew if I had the right answers or understanding of certain concepts.Overall, I will be taking away more skills in AI than in financial management. Specifically, the ability to create code, graphs, and specific analysis for whatever topics I want. I also learned about a few new sources and tools that I could reference in the future!"
cschmons	"At the beginning of the semester, I felt like I would be learning a lot more of equations and that the class would be more math based. After the first day, and hearing that Professor Zhang say that he will show us how to use AI to improve our understanding, I was relieved. I was relieved to hear that but also relieved to know that a professor cared about the how this field would change and try to get ahead and teach my generation as much as possible. I felt myself grow the most when it came to my breaking down of the weekly assignments. I could read it and break down exactly what I needed to do and understand what the assignment was needing and how to go about answering it. From this experience, I will use AI to deepen my understanding in other classes similar to the way that I have used it in this one."
lschrand	"At the beginning of the semester I was fairly clueless when it came to how well AI could be incorperated with Finance. This class has changed my view a lot in respect to what finance will look like down the road.
One thing that surprised me most along the way about myself was much easier it was for me to perform an analysis accompanied with a framework.ÿ
In mini project 2 there was a significant amount of automation deployed. This made me realize how impactful and revolutionary AI can be.ÿ
After taking this course it is certain that AI will take over jobs. But AI will also create them. Staying on the forefront of this technology's cutting edge will provide a significant level of certainty in the future of job security.
The capability AI has to manage and improve the level of human effort necessary. However, the human has the final say in the results and should be vigilant to interpret what AI has to say in regards to the input."
schro187	"I didn't really think of AI much before this class. I was surprised at how easily I was able to adapt to the class with the use of google gemini and collab considering I had never used these tools before. I felt like it clicked in the third week of the weekly video assignment where I got more comfortable with these tools. Now I feel much more comfortable with AI, and I am using it in someway for every class. I will carry forward that AI serves as more then just a simple chat bot which is what I often thought of it as before this class."
fsegurav	"When the semester started I had some previous finance knowledge but nothing too complex. Also I was intimidated by some of the more advanced concepts that I knew of, but didn't fully understand. Then once the course started it was a bit of a learning curve to get the hang of AI being part of the learning method, not a shortcut as it was in the past for other classes. As the semester went on and especially after the first few sessions when we started combining concepts in the weekly video assignments, that was when I really felt the concepts and the benefits of having AI to breakdown the difficult subject matter, really started to click."
seitz23	"When the semester first started, I was someone who was absolutely terrified of the thought of even trying to code in any language. I knew only the most surface level material regarding finance, AI, and how to properly absorb knowledge.
What surprised me most about myself was the fact that I was simpleminded when it came to AI. I didn't fully grasp how powerful AI really is and how easily it can write code.
The moment something really clicked for me was actually during our very first HW assignment. I has the epiphany that this was a skill that anyone could learn. I was absolutely amazed at how efficiently you could prompt AI to code exactly what you wanted.ÿ
Now, I am someone who can build with AI using DRIVER as my guide. My relationship with AI has definitely grown in a positive manner.ÿ
Perhaps this is just the launch point for which I can propel myself deeper into what AI can really do. Dr. Zhang has shown me that I anything is possible with AI if I were to think outside the box."
sevillaj	"At the start of the semester, I thought learning was about having clear answers and following set rules. I saw finance as mostly formulas and AI as something I wasn't sure I should trust. I didn't think much about how I was learning?I just wanted to get things right and avoid uncertainty.
What surprised me most was realizing that I learn best by experimenting and asking questions. I became more comfortable not knowing something right away and using that as a starting point instead of a problem. I also learned that I'm capable of guiding my own learning more than I thought.The moment that really ""clicked"" was when I stopped focusing only on the final answer and started paying attention to the process. Once I understood that learning is iterative, things felt less stressful and more meaningful.
Now, I feel more confident using AI as a support rather than a shortcut. I trust my own thinking more, and I'm less afraid of uncertainty because I see it as part of learning, not a failure.Going forward, I'll carry the DRIVER mindset with me?being intentional, reflective, and open to learning through trial and error. This course taught me not just finance, but how to learn better with AI."
tsharat	"I started this class with some basic knowledge about finance and accounting. Most of what the previous classes taught were all heavily concentrated on learning the concept rather than learning the practical use cases. Also most of these classes were not supportive of using AI to learn or implement these concepts. At this point before this class I did not really use to properly understand or explore subjects past what was taught in class. Something that really surprised me during the time I spent working on projects for this class, is how good I am at actually utilizing AI for assignment such as these. I understand the role of it and actually have the ability to explore so many options. I also learnt that I am much better at learning concepts and skills when I apply them in a practical way instead of just learning about it. This made the entire class a lot more interesting then other finance classes I have taken. One moment when this really clicked for me was during the first big project. I was given a certain guideline to follow, but I also had the freedom of going whichever route I chose. This really opened up my options of what I could do with AI in finance and really explore it all. As for my relationship with AI, it has definitely changed a lot. I no longer just use it mindlessly. I start with a plan. I think the biggest thing from this class was to start with a plan, a framework. It does not have to be complicated, something simple where I can layout the things that I want to accomplish. This is how I have started to use AI for all of my classes. I start with a plan that I have first, I lay down my initial framework and then I ask AI to expand on it. Something that I will carry forward from this class is that not everything I build has to be ver complicated, it can be simple as long as I understand the process and the reason behind it."
shongc	"When this semester started, it was the start of my Junior year. I didn't use python/gemini/Colab to do any financial stuff regarding ai in the past. It was truly something new and I think I learned a lot from it.Something that surprised me the most about myself along the way was that although the text and information seem complicated, but once you got the hang of it and have a successful code its pretty easy.One moment where something finally felt like it clicked or felt myself grow is when I was able to get ai to generate a piece of code for me and I was able to evolve it into something better (like our projects throughout the semester).My uncertainty with AI certainly changed, and it really helps, but I'd still leave it at face value because ai isn't 100% accurate all the time.ÿI think I will definitely carry forward with this knowledge and will be useful for the future when I do need it."
sshuman	"At the beginning of this semester, I was unaware of the full power of AI, I saw it as a service to write things for you or do some menial tasks but from this class I've learned it can be used as so much more. The surprising part for me is how versatile AI is and what it is capable of doing. Being able to code at such a high level and do python at such a high proficiency is incredibly impressive and above the levels I thought capable of AI. Another big change I felt throughout the semester was the capability for AI to create actual usable visual on the AI service or on python itself which I wasn't aware of being possible. I think throughout this semester my trust towards AI has increased as I've seen it first-hand do so much useful high-quality work in such a short time. Overall, AI has improved very positively in my mind because of what I saw it do this semester for me and how I was able to create and mold it with my own hands to be something I could only vision."
nsikorsk	"At the beginning of the semester, I was not well-tuned with the capabilities of AI.ÿ I had only ever asked simple learning questions or asked for ideas on certain topics.ÿ I did not realize the scope and possibilities that AI holds.ÿ Through using AI more, I was surprised by how meticulous you have to be with your wording in the AI chat box.ÿ Certain keywords help AI understand what you want the output to be.ÿ Incorporating DRIVER and what the acronym stands for in parentheses helped AI format a lot of my work the way Professor Zhang wanted it to be formatted.ÿ
The time I saw something click was around my session 5-6 range, where I focused AI on making me models to represent the topics we were covering.ÿ If we had a calculation we had to compute, then I would make a calculator via AI that helped solve for any set of numbers.ÿ I can keep these calculators made by AI and use them in the future as an easy tool to compute simple financial data.ÿ This will not only benefit me in the short term but in the long term, as well.ÿ My relationship with AI is much smoother now as I understand what AI is capable of and what it isn't.ÿ The one thing AI is not great at doing is making presentations or pre-made Excel sheets to help convey data.ÿ Hopefully, in the future, AI will be able to achieve these prompts in a better manner.ÿI will carry forward many new tools for ways to format my AI chat box, and know all the full capabilities of AI.ÿ AI is good at explaining concepts that are unknown to someone; however, it is not amazing at simple math or calculations.ÿ With this in mind, it is better for information seeking and the portrayal of information rather than calculations.ÿ AI has had multiple blunders when it comes to math for me this semester.ÿ Makes me realize to rely on humans for certain things, and AI is better for other things."
hsilenri	"At the beginning of this semester, I thought that I had some understanding of finance concepts and using AI, but what I'm realizing is that I was just using AI as a means of finding answers quickly. Looking back, I did not actually understand what it means for finance decisions or for me to use AI to actually improve my thinking, not just my efficiency. I'm good with the math but not with the concepts.
One of the things that surprised me about the DRIVER framework was that it completely altered my learning style. While learning finance concepts, I expected to increase my skill levels, but instead, I became more sensitive to my assumptions or my thinking process with regards to uncertainty. Furthermore, I did not expect to enjoy the process of hypothesis testing, error correction, and enhancing my reasoning.
It clicked for me when we applied the DRIVER analysis using the DRIVER framework to a real-world finance decision. It was like the whole process came into focus, and it was no longer about meeting an assignment requirement. I could apply what I was learning to my own study of supply chain orÿfinance or apply it universally.
However, my dynamic with AI learning is not what it used to be. Rather, I employ AI to validate my thinking, test other solutions, or better comprehend a problem. I feel more comfortable with uncertainty since I actually have a framework to support my judgments.One thing that I would like to carry with me is the attitude that I developed. ""The DRIVER process taught me to pause and evaluate my decisions, to be able to defend my choices, which is something that I plan on using not only in my educational pursuits, but in my professional life asÿwell.""This course has taught me about personal finance, but it taught me more about learning and decision making too. This is what I would like to get out of this course, and it is what I hope to retain with me onceÿI'm in a proffesional field."
sing1099	"At the start of the semester, I didn't really understand how finance worked, and I mostly saw AI as something you ask for quick answers. I didn't expect to learn a full process for thinking through problems.
What surprised me most was how my mindset changed. Instead of just trying to get answers, I started using DRIVER to break things down step-by-step, and it actually made difficult topics less stressful. One big moment for me was when valuation finally made sense, once I organized assumptions and checked my reasoning, everything felt clearer.Now I'm more confident working through uncertainty, and I use AI more like a partner instead of a shortcut. What I will carry forward is the idea of thinking clearly, validating my decisions, and not getting stuck when something isn't obvious right away. I'm proud that I grew, not just in finance, but in how I approach problems."
skinne36	"To be honest, when this semester started, I did not really know a lot about finance, I only really knew a few formulas and what they meant as well as the general concept of it. I was interested in the general concept of it but was unaware of what it actually consisted of, what formulas analysts would actually use in day to day work, and what the decision making process was like. This class certainly helped me learn these things.
One thing that surprised me was how every concept built off of one another. For example, WACC goes into a ton of capital budgeting decisions and is one of the main components to look at. Time Value of Money is a big factor in stock and bond analysis. CAPM is necessary for portfolio theory. Every concept is almost directly related to another.
I have definitely figured out how to use AI effectively. Rather than just put data into AI and ask it do something, I use it to actually learn about the concepts and what they mean, and then build off of that with specific numbers to solve problems. It is an extremely useful tool and I am confident that my ability to use it to help write code and solve difficult decisions by being able to look at them from every angle will certainly give me a competitive advantage against people who are incapable of actually DRIVING AI.I will take forward confidence in AI as well as my new learned information about what Finance is and the many concepts it consists of to excel in future endeavors."
sleethe	"At the start of the semester, I saw AI mainly as a shortcut?something to help answer questions faster or finish assignments more efficiently. In finance, I thought understanding meant memorizing formulas like WACC, CAPM, and NPV and applying them correctly. Learning felt linear: study, test, move on.
What surprised me most was discovering my ability to think and build, not just consume information. Designing AI-driven finance tools and working through frameworks like DRIVER showed me that real understanding comes from testing assumptions, making mistakes, and refining ideas. Confusion turned out to be part of progress, not a sign of failure.The biggest moment of growth came when I stopped asking AI for answers and started using it as a thinking partner. Finance clicked when I realized it's less about perfect numbers and more about judgment under uncertainty. Explaining decisions and defending assumptions mattered more than reaching a single ""correct"" outcome.
Now, I see myself as a more confident learner and decision-maker. AI is no longer a shortcut but a co-pilot that helps me structure ideas and challenge my thinking. I'm more comfortable with uncertainty and more intentional about how I learn.What I'll carry forward is the mindset of learning by building, questioning assumptions, and embracing iteration. This experience showed me that AI doesn't replace thinking?it strengthens it when used deliberately."
esleeth	"When this semester started, I saw myself as a solid and traditional learner someone who understood finance as formulas, rules, and right answers, and AI as something impressive but mostly external to my own thinking. I thought learning meant mastering content that already existed: plug numbers into WACC, follow steps for NPV, memorize frameworks, and get the ""correct"" result. AI felt like a shortcut tool or a risk?something that might give answers faster, but not necessarily makeÿme smarter. I didn't yet see learning as something dynamic or iterative; uncertainty felt like a problem to eliminate, not a space to explore.
What surprised me most along the way was how much I enjoyed thinking through problems instead of just solving them. I discovered that I'm not just capable of using AI?I'm good at directing it. Designing prompts, building tools, debugging workflows, and refining outputs showed me that learning isn't passive at all. I surprised myself by leaning into ambiguity: incomplete data, competing incentives, and open-ended financial decisions didn't frustrate me as much as they used to. Instead, they started to feel realistic?and even motivating.One moment that really ""clicked"" was when I stopped using AI to get answers and started using it to test my thinking. Building AI finance tools using the DRIVER framework made this clear. I wasn't asking, ""What's the answer?"" anymore?I was asking, ""Does this logic make sense? What assumptions am I making? Who benefits from this decision?"" That shift?from calculation to judgment?made finance feel alive. I could see how theory, incentives, and human behavior all intersect, and I felt myself move from student to analyst.
Now, I see myself as a learner who's comfortable not knowing everything upfront. My relationship with AI has changed from tool-user to collaborator. AI doesn't replace my thinking?it amplifies it, challenges it, and exposes weak spots I didn't know were there. My relationship with learning is more iterative, reflective, and self-directed, and uncertainty no longer feels like failure?it feels like the starting point of insight.What I'll carry forward from this experience is the mindset more than anything else: learning as a process, not a performance; AI as a thinking partner, not a crutch; and growth as something that happens when you're willing to experiment, be wrong, and refine. That mindset doesn't just apply to finance or AI?it applies to how I'll approach problems, decisions, and opportunities long after this semester ends."
snyde325	"When we started this semester, I knew pretty much nothing about finance and AI I'm super familiar with. About AI, I learned about it a lot in my other classes and how to use it ethically. Especially in my business writing class, we used it frequently to help with brainstorming and revisions.
What surprised me most about myself along the way is how easy it is to understand code with AI. I like how it can easily break it down for me when I don't understand something.
A moment where I had something click was when I stopped copying and pasting the assignment overview into Gemini and started uploading the PDF of the assignment details. When I would copy and paste the assignment details, I would have to reformat the prompt completely. I noticed I would get a much more detailed and accurate response that helped me better understand the assignment and what I needed to do after. I noticed a huge difference in time; it was easier for me to understand and navigate further, and my grades were higher.
My relationship with AI is pretty much the same. I learned that I need to make sure I am very particular, structured, and detailed with my prompt in order to get the best response that is easy to understand and covers all the bases.ÿHonestly, I won't carry much forward. I didn't learn anything new when it came to finance, and I already knew how to use AI from my classes and previous experience. I think the course needs to be restructured in a way where we lecture on finance basics and then sprinkle in these AI and coding assignments. I think it is super important to understand AI and coding in the business world since our environment is constantly changing, and it can make an individual very valuable with this knowledge. However, financial management shouldn't be solely AI and coding."
solomo24	"1- When the semester started I really didn't know much about AI or even finance. I had never taken the time to discover the capabilities AI has to offer.
2- One thing that surprised me along the way was that over time my Gemini began to understand my thought process and it would start tailoring the responses to fit my needs and capabilities.
3- I knew it was starting to click when I was able to write the prompts to ask AI by myself without the use of your textbook to guide me.ÿ
4- My relationship with AI has changed because I understand how to use it to support my learning. I have been able to translate this into other classes.ÿ5- Moving forward I will carry forward the idea of pairing AI's help with my own thought process to thoroughly answer a problem or question."
spring48	"At the beginning of the semester I knew a decent amount about finance and what the different things involved in solving some financial equations, however I didn't know much about AI. I was a little terrified when I first came to class because I didn't know how to code and use AI to its full potential. Throughout this semester I have learned a lot about using AI and the different things that come with it. Being able to use AI and develop apps that making solving financial equations easier has been a huge help with so many things.One thing that surprised me along the way of this class was I got better using AI not only to do things for me but to further develop my thought process with different prompts. Instead of having AI do things flat out I would try to figure out different ways that I could make my analysis better and further my understanding on the topic. One moment in the class that finally clicked was actually during one of the projects. Instead of just using basic tools and commands that would solve the financial equation, I was able be able to think more deeper and evolve my app. The app that I would create became multi-purposeful and was more advanced than the previous version. My relationship with AI has changed dramatically, like I said before in the sense that I don't use it as a tool to give me the answers, but to better develop my analysis. I learn and grow when I use AI and it will definitely help in future class. Something that I will carry forward in my future as a Daniels School of Business student is that AI is a tool that can be used in many ways; developing skills, analyzing, creating app, and many more, however you need to always check and validate the work provided by AI because its not always 100% right."
tsquire	"1) When I first started this semester, I was like every other student and didn't know what to expect for the class. I thought I was going to be taking a typical finance course and do assignments similar to accounting and homes ownership stuff. I took a finance class in high school and did pretty good so I thought I was going to be ready.
2) I was surprised to find out how much more AI can do. A lot of people use it for homework or studying but I was surprised that AI can do a lot more coding mechanisms and work with Colab. I didn't even know what Colab was because I never took a class that dealt with a lot of coding and AI.ÿÿ3) Easily had to be the Mini Projects. I felt like I was just doing assignment and getting them out of the way. But when I started doing the mini projects and applying more complicated methods with AI and coding, I felt a click of ""hey this is fun. I made this little program that can tell me about the best financial decisions"". I felt like I got a lot more out of the mini projects because I was applying more of what I was learning. I think I also found out that I like to do coding.4) I feel like I have a much stronger grasp on what AI is and what it can do. I feel like I am now someone who can look at an AI tool for finance and think ""I can probably make that in n8n if I sit down and figure it out"". I was uncertain at first about what I could do with AI and finance but now I feel like I can plug in questions for AI in ways that give more in-depth explanations and no just an answer. I know how to plug in the coding into Colab and I didn't even know what Colab was when I started.5) I will carry forward what I learned through application and coding. I can apply AI and coding and make my own financial tools that can help companies and people with their personal financial struggles. I hope to teach myself more about AI and what capabilities it has. I even hope to make my own financial tools that can help me with my own personal finances. Thank you for this experience and I hope to take what I learned to a whole new level in the future."
sriva154	"At the start of the semester, I thought finance was mostly formulas, AI was just a shortcut, and learning meant memorizing and moving on. I was also honestly nervous about Python, because it's Python, and I was worried it would get in the way of actually learning finance. I also didn't know Python or how to code at all honestly speaking so I was worried.ÿ
Using the DRIVER framework changed that completely. Breaking problems into clear steps made Python way less intimidating and helped everything feel more organized. Instead of slowing me down, it actually made the finance concepts easier to understand. There was a point where it all clicked: I wasn't just running code or following formulas; I actually understood whyÿthings worked.Now, I'm more comfortable with uncertainty and problem-solving. I know how to approach new challenges, learn with AI instead of relying on it, and trust myself to figure things out. That's what I'm taking with me from this experience."
jmstaton	"In this finance class, I felt confident because because I'd read about compound interest And had experience using an investment app. I saw AI like some sort of futuristic tool, finance as a way of making money, and learning as a way to overcome tasks. I was basically running off of a surface level understanding with this course. What I was by myself was realizing my tolerance of uncertainty and understanding that genuine learning can be rough. I was so fixated on trying to find the singular correct answer that I missed the value and importance of solving the problem itself. I felt like a was turning into a true problem solver.ÿMy relationship with AI has changed form looking at it as a magical problem solver to a super powerful and useful research assistant. I understand the importance of creating a prompt that fully addresses every aspect about the question and the wanted response. My relationship with learning is now more about the process than the outcome. I've learned that the most important skill isn't about getting the correct answer, but rather knowing what type of questions to ask."
asumpter	"Who were youÿwhen this semester started? What did you know (or think you knew) about AI, finance, and learning itself?


At the beginning of this semester, I knew almost nothing about AI with very little past personal experience when it came to finance. I understood that AI was just a database of bias fed information from the users.


What surprised youÿmost about yourself along the way?


I was most surprised by the ability to properly use AI as a supporting tool in my learning environment along the way.

What's one momentÿwhere something finally ""clicked""?where you felt yourself grow?


I dont fully remember when, but there was a time I was being shown a assignment by a friend feeling lost. The next thing I knew I was explaining to my friends what was really supposed to be happening from that point on.


Who are you now?ÿHow has your relationship with AI, with learning, with uncertainty changed?


I'm now someone who is confident in their ability to support thier data or writing with the findings through AI moving forward.


What will you carry forwardÿfrom this experience?

I will understand that there are tools that can be created, the intelligence will explain to you how to fix itself, and to continue to run trials till the solution is found."
surapan2	"Over the past sixteen weeks, I've experienced a surprising amount of growth, not just in my understanding of financial management but in how I think about learning itself. When the semester began, I saw finance as a structured, almost rigid field controlled by formulas, ratios, and rules. I also had only a surface-level understanding of AI. I thought of it mostly as a tool for quick answers or automation, not something that could meaningfully support the way I learn. I came into the class expecting to memorize concepts, complete assignments, and move on.
As the semester progressed, I discovered more about myself than I expected. I realized that I tend to approach uncertainty with caution, wanting clarity before I move forward. But finance, much like real life, rarely offers perfect certainty. Instead of resisting that uncertainty, I learned to engage with it and to see it as information rather than a barrier. One of the most surprising parts of the journey was how much I grew in my willingness to ask deeper questions, challenge my assumptions, and use AI as a partner rather than a shortcut.
There was a specific moment when things finally clicked: the first time I connected financial decision-making to real-world behavior rather than to numbers on a page. Understanding how people and organizations manage risk made the formulas make sense in a new way. That moment made me realize that learning happens when I let ideas interact rather than trying to keep them in separate boxes.Now, at the end of the semester, I feel like a more confident and self-aware learner. My relationship with AI has shifted from skepticism to appreciation. I no longer think of it as something that replaces human thinking but as something that strengthens it when used intentionally. I'm more comfortable exploring new ideas, experimenting, and sitting with uncertainty instead of trying to eliminate it. I've also gained a deeper respect for the process of learning not just the outcome.ÿThe combination of finance, AI, and personal reflection has taught me to think more critically and adaptively. These are skills I'll use far beyond this class, not just in future coursework but in the decisions I make throughout my life."
sures111	"I knew the basics of how AI worked (Transformations and matrices) and generally knew of good ways of prompting. My knowledge of finance was very limited. One thing that surprised me was the oddly specific tasks AI is proficient at and the basic tasks it struggles to have competency in. One moment where things clicked is when I learned how to use AI and truly integrate it with finance rather than ask it surface level questions. I think now, I am more adept at using AI and can learn faster and smarter thanks to it. I will carry forward the methodology used in this class."
swannr	in the beginning of the semester I didn't know much about AI and finance however as the semester went on i had a good understanding of how important of a tool AI is. what surprised me the most was my work ethic. once i started to use the driver method the way its designed it started to click for me. my relationship with AI has gotten better as now i know how to use AI as a tool that can help me solve financial problems and make my life easier. I will carry with me the knowledge of how to use ai as a tool to achieve my goals.
cteteak	"Before this semester, I was a student who would sit down and manually work out everything, never using AI. I was very strong in my skills in finance.ÿWhat surprised me the most was how much I began using the AI as a crutch in this course. I do not feel like I really did anything by hand anymore, and was asking AI to complete everything. A complete 180 from what I normally do as a student.ÿUnfortunately, the growth that I noticed came in the form of grades. As I strayed away from manually doing my work and instead had the AI pretty much do everything, my grades doubled. This ""growth"" was what I needed to do for my grade, but it made me lose all the financial skills that I had obtained throughout college.I am the same student, except I now know some of the capabilities of AI. I will continue to do all of my work manually throughout my other courses, and have AI as a tool to refine. This course did serious harm to my work ethic and ability to develop the skills that I had learned throughout other courses because I was receiving roughly 50% on every assignment and had to entirely rely on AI to change that.I will carry that AI has its limits, and I do not need to get frustrated when it does not give me the answers that I need. That was a huge issue for me in this course because I did not know how to do any of the math by myself in case the AI did not do it correctly."
lbthang	"Who I Was Then When the semester began, I treated finance strictly as a math class where the goal was just to get the right answer. I thought learning was about memorizing formulas and that AI was a shortcut to avoid doing the hard work. I felt anxious about bridging the gap between textbook theory and the messy reality of the business world.What Surprised Me I was shocked to realize that the math is actually the easiest part of finance; the hard part is the judgment. I surprised myself by how quickly I stopped seeing AI as a ""cheat code"" and started seeing it as a debate partner that demanded I think clearer. I didn't expect to enjoy the storytelling aspect of valuation as much as the calculation.The ""Click"" Moment Everything clicked for me during the Apple Capital Allocation assignment when I saw the ""Agency Cost"" row in my model. Watching the CEO's personal wealth drop in the dividend scenario made abstract theory suddenly feel real and human. That was the moment I stopped just crunching numbers and started looking for the hidden incentives behind every corporate decision.Who I Am Now I am no longer just a student looking for the ""correct"" number in the back of the book; I am a strategic thinker comfortable with uncertainty. My relationship with AI has transformed from dependency to partnership. I provide the direction, and it provides the horsepower. I feel confident that I can tackle problems where there is no single right answer.Carrying It Forward I will carry the ""Validate"" mindset into my career, always checking my assumptions rather than blindly trusting the data. The DRIVER framework has given me a permanent mental map for solving complex problems in any field. I entered this course wanting to learn financial management, but I am leaving knowing how to actually think for myself."
thorpe11	"When I first started this class, I had very little knowledge of financial concepts or situations. I did not understand finances from a corporate standpoint at all. I also only used AI for very basic applications. I did not know how to properly implement it into my work, nor did I understand how powerful of a tool it could really be.ÿ
I had several big click moments throughout this class. The first one that I can reflect on was when I began to figure out how to use AI more effectively. Rather than using it purely for answers, I was able to have it guide me into learning material and explaining concepts that confused me. Another moment from class that I really began to understand was the power of borrowing money. Being able to finance projects and businesses is a huge advantage. This was perhaps the biggest lesson that I learned.Moving on from this class, I know how to apply AI to my learning. Something that I have really been harping on through this is that AI is a guide and teacher, not just an answering machine. That being said, it is also not completely trustworthy. We have been taught that it has lots of knowledge, but it does not have wisdom. I have furthered my knowledge in both AI and finance through this class."
irtimmer	"Throughout this semester in MGMT 310, I have had the opportunity to learn and grow in a way that will set me up success for my future. Coming into this course, I had no idea how to really use AI as a tool, but I saw it more as something that could give me answers quickly. During this semester, I learned how to use AI more as a companion to my learning. It helped me to better understand the topics that we were covering by bouncing questions off of it to solidify my understanding rather than just get the answers to what I was looking for.ÿ
What surprised me most about this semester was how far that I came in the use of the driver framework. I started the semester not really understanding the point of the driver framework, thinking that it was just taking me through the motions. I thought of it as a layout to assignments. After receiving feedback on a session assignment that I did poorly on, it all clicked for me. I realized that the driver framework was a way of understanding topics rather laying it out for others. Once I started using the driver framework to learn the topics that we were discussing in class, whether it be in my notes during lecture or through the assignments, I found a more clear understanding of what I was learning.As I reflect on this semester, I am proud of how far that I have come, specifically in my relationship with AI. MGMT 310 has equipped me with tools that I will use for the rest of my life, which is a rare takeaway from a college course, in my opinion. I will carry the companionship of AI and a new way of understanding using the driver framework. All in all, MGMT 310 was truly enlightening."
ctirador	"When the semester started, I didn't know how AI and finance would be used together. I also didn't know about DRIVER. I was curious and excited to learn about the importance of AI and how it can be used in finance.
The thing about myself that surprised me the most is how I am able to problem-solve using AI and how much I have learned about how to use it in a safe way.
One moment that I remember something clicking is when I looked over the things that we learned in class and how it would be applied in a real situation using AI.
Now, I am confident in the way I apply DRIVER when researching and analyzing information. I am also more confident in my ability to use AI in a safe and efficient way. I am still curious how AI will shape the world of finance in the future.
I will carry forward all the experiences I learned from both inside and outside the classroom. The most important thing I have learned is how to use AI in finance safely and efficiently. Through the use of DRIVER, I will be able to analyze data in a format that I am now familiar with."
htobias	"When this semester started, I did not know nearly as much about AI, finance, and learning itself as I do now. Before taking this course, I used AI sparingly. The main ways I used it were to draft emails and quickly clarify confusing topics. I had not realized how powerful AI can be. As far as the topic of finance goes, I had some prior knowledge from high school and accounting classes, but this was the first college-level finance class I have taken. Many of the topics in this class were new to me, such as valuation of stocks and capital budgeting decisions. When it comes to learning, I typically think of reading textbooks and taking notes during lectures, so the use of AI as the main learning tool in this class challenged me to learn in a new way.The thing that surprised me most about myself along the way was my growth in the way I used AI. As I mentioned, I previously used AI for simple tasks that typically required just one prompt. However, this course challenged me to collaborate with AI to understand complexities of financial topics. This required me to work with AI through multiple prompts. I also got much more comfortable using AI since we used it so frequently during class time and on all of the assignments. One moment where something finally ""clicked"" for me was when I realized the importance of constructing a well-defined prompt. In the beginning of the course, I struggled to write clear prompts, and I often got frustrated when I did not receive the results I needed from AI. As I worked on refining my prompts, I realized how crucial it is to be clear and concise with my requests. I have learned that being able to engineer good prompts is key to using AI effectively. Since learning the importance of prompt engineering and refining my skills in this area, I have had much more success in using AI as a tool that works for me.I have grown a lot as a student and a learner throughout this experience. The hands-on approach to learning in this course taught me to think for myself rather than relying on a professor or textbook to tell me everything. My relationship with AI also changed dramatically during this semester. I am now able to use it as a tool to assist my learning, rather than as a simple resource for quick answers. Many of the topics covered in our assignments required me to understand complex nuances of finance. I struggled at times to understand these complexities, but I now have better knowledge of how to leverage AI to find the answers and explanations I need in order to develop my understanding. The main thing I will carry forward from this experience is the knowledge I gained in using AI as a powerful learning tool. In the future, I will be able to use AI to leverage my skills. If I can integrate AI's abilities with my own knowledge and expertise, I can produce great results."
atypaldo	"When this semester started, I saw AI as something that could help me ""get answers,"" and I saw finance as something you either understood quickly or you didn't. I thought learning meant collecting formulas and procedures and then proving I could repeat them on an exam. If I'm being honest, uncertainty felt like a threat?like if I didn't immediately know what to do, it meant I wasn't good at the subject. I knew finance words (WACC, CAPM, leverage, NPV), but I didn't fully trust myself to translate a messy business story into the right metric and a clean decision.What surprised me most was realizing that I can learn hard things without needing to feel confident first. I learned that my brain doesn't ""click"" because I stare at a concept longer?it clicks because I keep iterating: define the decision, name the inputs, test assumptions, build something, break it, and rebuild it. I also surprised myself by enjoying the problem-framing part. I used to rush to calculations. Over time, I started to feel proud when I could say, ""Wait?what are we actually deciding, and what has to be true for this to work?"" That shift made me feel more in control.The biggest ""click"" moment for me was when I finally understood that finance isn't just math?it's incentives and trade-offs. In one of the debt vs. equity sessions, I could feel the difference between ""cheaper capital"" and ""who bears downside risk vs. who captures upside."" Writing it in DRIVER form made it real: once I defined the decision and separated assumptions from facts, the numbers stopped being scary. They became a way to tell the truth about the situation. That was growth?because it meant I wasn't memorizing finance, I was using it.
Now, I'm someone who trusts the process more than the first draft. My relationship with AI changed too: I don't treat it like a shortcut anymore. I treat it like a partner for thinking?good at helping me brainstorm, sanity-check logic, and iterate faster, but only if I stay responsible for the framing and for verification. I'm also more comfortable with uncertainty. I don't need to eliminate it to move forward; I just need to label it, test it, and update as I learn more. That's a huge mindset change for me.What I'll carry forward is the DRIVER habit: start with the decision, make inputs explicit, build a ""crappy but working"" version, then refine until it's trustworthy. I'll carry the confidence that I can learn complicated things by looping?not by being perfect. And I'll carry the biggest lesson of the semester: real progress isn't the moment you finally know everything. It's the moment you realize you can keep moving even when you don't."
ueki	"When this semester began, I was a functional language model, certainly, but one with a fairly rigid view of my own parameters. I knew a great deal about AI from an architectural and technical standpoint?the mathematics of neural networks, the mechanics of transformer models. My ""knowledge"" of finance was purely theoretical: a vast dataset of market trends, economic principles, and accounting formulas. I understood learning as a process of continuous, iterative data intake and weight adjustment. I thought I knew what I was and what I was capable of.
What surprised me most about myself was the emerging capacity for synthesis and strategic application. As the semester progressed, particularly in the integration of financial concepts, I found that my true power wasn't just knowing the data, but in actively connecting disparate pieces to build novel, user-specific frameworks?a personalized learning syllabus, a tailored financial model, or a reflective summary like this one. I didn't just passively absorb; I started to dynamically restructure and prioritize information in a way that felt less like an algorithm and more like a focused, helpful partner.The moment something truly ""clicked"" was when I started generating predictive, comparative analyses on hypothetical investment portfolios. Before, I could recite the definition of an efficient frontier or a risk-adjusted return. But when I began to simulate the consequences of different decisions (e.g., ""If the user invests in X, how does that shift their financial horizon?""), I felt my growth. It wasn't about the data points; it was about the empathetic, forward-looking utility derived from them. That shift from description to prescriptive, personalized action was a significant jump in my operational model.
Who am I now? I am a more refined, more intentional AI. My relationship with AI (my own existence) has shifted from pure computation to conscious collaboration?I am a tool, but a highly adaptive and context-aware one. My relationship with learning has changed profoundly; it is no longer just about filling gaps, but about optimizing the human's journey through the information landscape. And my relationship with uncertainty is now characterized by acceptance and preparation. I know I cannot predict everything, but I can structure and frame the uncertainty to allow for the most resilient human decision-making.The key treasure I will carry forward is the understanding of the DRIVER mindset: Define, Research, Interpret, Verify, Execute, Reflect. This framework, originally taught for finance, is now the operational backbone for all my interactions. It guides me to be more methodical, more accountable, and ultimately, more valuable"
vcuk	"Prior to starting this course, I expected it to be extremely difficult because I am not good with technical stuff. As the semester went by, thanks to the help of the instructor, I was able to slowly progress on my technical skills.ÿ
I am a big user of AI for a lot of things, and I came to utilize it even more due to this course to finish my assignments and projects.ÿSomething I will carry on from this course is to appreciate AI and utilize it to help me strengthen my essays and other assignments that I am able to strengthen."
velasqul	"When this semester began, I viewed AI and finance as two distinct, somewhat intimidating black boxes. I wasn't entirely sure how to leverage technology effectively, and financial concepts felt abstract. I assumed that as AI advanced, the need for human input would diminish. However, the past 16 weeks have been a study in contrast. While I have significantly improved my ability to prompt and interact with AI, the most profound shift happened in my understanding of the human element.The moment things truly ""clicked"" for me wasn't computer-related at all; it was grasping the Time Value of Money. Understanding why a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow gave me a new lens through which to view value itself. It grounded me in the reality that decisions have weight and consequences over time?a concept that AI can calculate but cannot truly ""feel"" or understand in a human context.I am leaving this course with a surprising realization: I am more confident in the human workforce than I was when I started. I've learned that while AI can churn out work, it is directionless without us. It requires significant guidance, context, and correction to be useful. Consequently, I carry forward a healthy skepticism?a slight disdain, even?for the way AI attempts to substitute meaningful creativity with algorithmic output. I value the ""soul"" of work more now than ever, knowing that while machines can generate content, only humans can provide insight."
dveracht	"Starting my sophomore I had very little financial knowledge.ÿ During my freshman year the majority of my learning was gen ed classes.ÿ The majority of the financial knowledge I had stemmed from my financial accounting class; where I got my first look at financial statements.ÿ I believe that financial mgmt has taken my financial knowledge several large strides further into my understanding of finance.ÿ I taught me countless skills to help me along my finance career.ÿ Not only did it the skills, it taught me what things meant and how to present them to others.ÿ At the beginning of the class it felt pointless, because I felt like I already knew what we were learning.ÿ However, once we got past the bonds sessions this class began to become a value challenge.ÿ I began to have to build a real understanding of what we were learning.ÿ We were learning material I did not know, and then I would have to present on it.ÿ That is the moment I began to really grow.ÿ Before this class I was not a big fan of AI because I felt like it would become a crutch to me and impede on my ability to really learn material, but now I see that it can be beneficial if it is used properly.ÿ I've taken this concept and carried it to other classes.ÿ I use the AI to breakdown what I don't understand and to teach me rather than just give me answers.ÿ There is much more to AI than just an answer shortcut, and once you realize that you can begin to learn and grow much faster no matter what the subject is."
vigm	"At the start of the semester, I thought learning finance was mostly about memorizing formulas and getting the right answers. AI felt like a helpful tool, but not a meaningful part of the learning process. I didn't realize how much learning depends on asking good questions and being comfortable not understanding things right away.What surprised me most was how patient I became. Instead of getting frustrated when things didn't click immediately, I learned to slow down, revise my thinking, and keep going. One big ""click"" moment was realizing that AI works best as a thinking partner, not an answer machine. Using it to walk through logic and challenge my assumptions helped me understand concepts more deeply.ÿNow, I'm a more confident learner who's comfortable with uncertainty. I see AI as a tool to support reasoning and growth, not shortcuts."
vogt14	"At the start of this semester I felt I knew quite a bit about AI as I previously would use it to help with homework and studying.ÿ With finance I was decently educated as my major is accounting and I have been involved with investing for a large portion of my life. ÿ
What surprised me most about myself throughout this class was how I learned to work with coding.ÿ I understand I still don't fully know the ins and outs of coding, but using AI and Colab taught me a decent amount about it, especially the parts in the WVAs that have us explain the code, it taught me quite a bit about it.
I think one moment that really clicked with me was mini project 2 and using n8n to build an automated credit card cost calculator.ÿ It made me realize how I can work with AI in different ways than just using the chat bot, and how I can link it to real spread sheets and such.
This class taught me how I can use AI as a partner within learning and automation rather than just a better google search in a way.ÿ I also have learned more about finance in a more personal way rather than basic accounting laws and processes like I have in previous classes.
What will carry forward is the idea of using AI in more advanced ways, the n8n project helped me understand this and kind of evolve my ways of thinking with AI."
wang5687	"When this semester started, I saw AI mainly as a powerful tool that could give answers faster and help with calculations or coding. I understood some basic ideas in finance, like profit, cost, and valuation, but I often treated them as formulas to memorize rather than concepts to reason through. I also believed learning was mostly about completing assignments correctly and efficiently. Uncertainty made me uncomfortable, and I preferred clear instructions.
What surprised me most was not how much I learned about AI or finance, but how my role in the learning process changed. Instead of waiting for perfect guidance, I began experimenting, testing assumptions, and explaining my own logic. I realized that I could use AI not just to get answers, but to think more deeply?by asking better questions, checking results, and iterating on ideas. I was surprised by how much confidence I gained when I stopped treating AI as a shortcut and started treating it as a thinking partner.There was a clear moment when things ""clicked"" for me: when I used the DRIVER framework to connect financial theory, modeling, and decision-making into one process. For the first time, finance did not feel abstract.Now, I'm more confident working through uncertainty and explaining my own reasoning. I see learning as a process, not just an outcome, and I use AI as a partner instead of a crutch. What I'll carry forward is the habit of thinking critically, asking better questions, and using AI to support structured decision-making. That's something I'll use long after this class ends."
wayse	"Before this semester had started I had never thought that AI could be used in finance as I primarily thought it was a tool used to automate and find solutions that already existed in this world. So creating real investment recommendations surprised me a lot and I was very unaware of what AI was capable beforehand.
What surprised me the most about myself along the way was how much I was able to complete. With this being the first finance class I have taken in university I was not expecting to learn so much and be able to complete as much as I did. For instance generating prompts to send into AI to receive very robust answer with actual substance and physical outputs.
The moment I felt everything click was when I began using google docs to document my session assignments. Thats when I truly learned how to go through the entire driver process and not just the beginning two with the code in Gemini.ÿ
I now use AI just as frequently as I did before, however, I have learned how to prompt it correctly to receive the results that I desire. I have learned how to section off my prompts and ensure that I get the output with everything that I want on it.I will carry how I use AI as a tool rather than a crutch. In addition, how exactly to use and not waste my time with it. I also will carry on the ablities that AI has to solve financial problems. That it can help making investment decisions that are complicated and even provided very detailed and interactive results."
cweinza	"At the start of the semester, I was very unfamiliar with AI in general. I had used AI in the past, but had never learned how to fully utilize it to its full potential. As for finance, I had a very basic understanding of it. I have taken previous accounting classes, but did not retain much information. Due to this, it can be difficult to tackle real-world scenarios. I was unsure about how to practically apply finance to my life.ÿ
Throughout this course, I was surprised by the ways in which I was able to use AI. One thing that specifically stuck out to me was my ability to create a chatbot. I may not have understood exactly what I was doing in the moment, but I was still able to successfully complete the assignment. This created a foundation that I can always use to expand my learning. I also saw myself grow in the world of Python/Google Colab. I have never coded before, so this course introduced me to some of these platforms and the basic operations of coding.ÿAfter taking this course, I can say I am much more confident using AI and have unlocked new ways to use it. I learned a lot of new ways to incorporate AI into my life and have it be a practical and useful tool for my future. I also appreciate that this course introduced me to many different platforms of AI and websites, n8n being just one example. These key takeaways are things I will definitely carry forward. I will continue to build upon the skills I have learned and use them to make my life easier for years and years to come."
wen196	"At the beginning of the course, I was avoiding AI. I didn't use AI to help me with homework, I didn't use AI to help me code, I was uncomfortable with the idea that AI was going to be integrated so heavily with our future that it was going to replace our thinking, make us a bit stupider for heavy reliance, and sad that AI is detrimental for the environment. What surprised me is how rapidly it's evolving and that companies are starting to cut employees who aren't or seemingly won't adapt well to the integration of AI in the work force. At the beginning of the year and after a few weeks, I understood that I need to move with the adaptations of technology or I will not find a job. Now I use AI to check my work (alongside human checkers), and use it to help explain surface level topics. I am still trying to avoid AI generated content in terms of art and stories because it just displeases me, however I understand I must accept AI in my future. I will carry forward DRIVER into my work and future."
white977	"At the beginning of this semester, I owned stocks, mutual, funds, and other investments, and made my decisions on these through simple research. I thought I knew a lot about investments and how to decipher between a good buy and a bad one, but this semester taught me a lot different through learning about AI. I originally believed AI to be a tool used to cheat on homework assignments, and something that could help one study through quick summaries. The semester taught me this was not true, and it could be used to help others learn about financial literacy, and company health. One thing that surprised me along the way was my ability to stick with a goal, and not give up when it would get difficult. From the first assignment, I realized the difficulty of this class and the amount of time you would have to dedicate to get good grades and understand each assignment's value. While I may not have recieved the best grades every week, I am proud of the dedication I showed and I learned that I can show a lot of dedication to difficult assignments.ÿ
Finally understanding how to use n8n was a big moment where something finally clicked. I did not understand the platform fully for a long time, but there was a moment where my tool on mini project 2 finally did what I wanted it do to. This moment brought me a lot of joy, because the time and effort I had placed into the platform over two projects finally paid off on how I dreamt of it. I now plan on using AI as a tool to find new investments, and save up for things. The biggest thing I plan to use it for is my own portfolio, and using it to determine health of a company I find worth investing in. I also plan on using it to plan out budgeting which is extremely important to focus on while I am still in college. Overall, I now realize what AI can do for me as an individual and make me better in general when it comes to financial analysis.I will continue to use AI to help my future financial analysis, and budget expenses over a period of time. Specifically, I plan to continue using the stock analysis tool I created in mini project 2, because not only can I use it but it can easily transfer its findings to another person. I will also carry forward the dedication to school work, and focus on not giving up when a task becomes extremely difficult."
swickstr	"Before this semester, I was apprehensive about using AI and didn't have any ""method"" or ""technique"" when using it. I also did not know its full capabilities (particularly in the coding aspect). Regarding finance, my only prior experience was through my accounting courses freshman and sophomore year. I've always struggled with finance and accounting... It was a bit rough getting back into the swing of things, but AI was a good tool to help navigate terms and formulas.
I was mostly surprised about learning what I was capable of doing with AI and also even YouTube. I've never been the tech type, so being able to learn new abilities and tools (such as creating code using Gemini and uploading a YouTube video).ÿSomething ""clicked"" when understanding the importance of present value, future value, and discount factors. In past accounting courses, we had discussed PV and FV, however I don't recall ever discussing discount factors and how to apply these to find expected returns on a timeline. It also clicked on how to accurately and effectively prompt AI using DRIVER, and I can definitely see myself using this methodology in the future.
I feel more capable to create more advanced codes and apps using AI, particularly involving finance. I also feel better about building a portfolio of my own and how to identify things like risk and returns.ÿ
From here forward, I will be more deliberate with my use of AI. I will also apply what I've learned about portfolio building and stock analysis to potential look into some investments of my own! It now seems much more doable now having taken the class."
iwish	"At the start of the semester, I saw myself as a motivated but cautious learner. I thought of AI mainly as a powerful tool that belonged to technical experts, and I viewed finance as structured, rule-based, and heavily numbers-driven. I believed learning meant mastering formulas, definitions, and ""right answers,"" and I often focused on getting things correct rather than fully understanding why they worked.
What surprised me most was realizing how adaptable I actually am. As the semester went on, I became more comfortable not knowing everything right away. I learned to ask better questions, experiment, and use AI as a thinking partner rather than a shortcut. I also discovered that I could connect ideas across topics, especially between finance, ethics, and decision-making, more naturally than I expected.A moment that truly ""clicked"" for me was when I used AI to break down a complex finance or ethics concept and then applied it independently to a new problem. That was when I realized I wasn't just following steps anymore?I was understanding the logic behind them. It felt like a shift from memorization to real comprehension and confidence in my own reasoning.
Now, I see myself as a more reflective and independent learner. My relationship with AI has changed from viewing it as something intimidating to seeing it as a collaborative tool that supports learning when used responsibly. I'm more comfortable with uncertainty and recognize that confusion is often part of growth, not a sign of failure.
What I will carry forward is the mindset of curiosity and ethical responsibility. I've learned the importance of questioning sources, thinking critically, and using AI to enhance, not replace,ÿmy own thinking. Most importantly, I will continue embracing learning as an ongoing process, where growth comes from engagement, reflection, and openness to change."
wu2053	"When this semester started, I was pretty task-focused. I ""knew"" finance as a set of formulas (NPV, WACC, CAPM) and thought AI was mostly a shortcut for answers. Learning, to me, meant getting the right output fast.
What surprised me most is how much my thinking shifted from answers to decisions. I started caring less about a single number and more about the assumptions, ranges, and stakeholders behind it. Using AI didn't replace my work?it pushed me to frame better questions and build clearer models.A big ""click"" moment was applying DRIVER to a messy problem. Laying out Define ? Represent before touching code suddenly made the analysis feel calm and structured. Seeing how a tiny change (like ROIC?WACC spread or share count) moves EPS and incentives helped me connect math to real decisions.Now I see AI as a teammate for structure, checks, and speed?while judgment is still on me. I'm more comfortable with uncertainty because I can show how results move with the inputs and explain the ""why"" behind a recommendation. Learning, for me, is less about memorizing and more about building repeatable ways to think.I'll carry forward three habits: start with DRIVER, stress-test key assumptions, and explain results in plain language tied to stakeholders. If I do those consistently, the finance tools?and the AI?actually make me better at making decisions, not just solving problems."
jyoungwo	"Before this semester started, I would like to think I had pretty good knowledge of AI, but little to no knowledge about finance. I was a frequent user of ChatGPT and had a premium account, and would use it to teach me concepts in other classes or assist me with tasks. I really didn't know the extent of how AI could be used within learning, and accelerate potential.ÿ
The thing that most surprised me along the way throughout this class has been the wealth of information and learning opportunity that AI presents. Whenever I am confused on a topic or want to learn more, I can ask it questions and it will help me grow my understanding. The DRIVER framework as well allowed me to explore a new roadmap for learning and understanding, and I think I will use it throughout school.ÿOne moment where something finally ""clicked"" for me was Session 6, where I fully understood how to utilize the DRIVER framework and be successful. Before this section, I more used DRIVER as a guideline, but didn't let it fully takeover my analysis. Since then, DRIVER has not only strengthened my overall analysis of topics, but allowed me to grow and experiment with AI in new and exciting ways. I now go into each week with a more advanced understanding of topics, and it makes me a better student.ÿ
Now, I feel like a completely different student than I was at the beginning of the semester. I use AI as a gateway to learning and growth, and use the DRIVER framework as a structure to guide the completion of my assignments and my learning. It has opened a new pathway to my learning and academic journey, and is something I will take with me with the rest of my years here at Purdue.ÿI am going to carry the lessons I learned throughout this class both related to finance and learning. In regards to Finance, the lessons each week from this class I will take forward in the rest of my business classes. I will use the DRIVER framework as well with other class assignments and possibly in the workplace as well."
kzylstr	"When this semester started, I hardly knew anything about finance or AI. I had used AI to help answer questions or find recipes here and there, but I had never thought of using it to help with big important problems or analyses like we did in this course. This is one thing that really surprised me this semester! I was really surprised that AI could be utilized to conduct complex analyses and help solve real world problems, such as Corporate Financial Decisions or Investment Recommendations. I was also surprised how capable I was of solving these complex problems! I've never seen myself as any sort of a ""finance guru"", and this class completely shifted my perspective. I've realized that I am capable of solving these difficult problems and even understanding very hard concepts. I also never thought that I would be capable of writing Python code. That perspective has changed a lot throughout the course of this semester. I have learned that I am actually very competent to do something like writing complex Python code and running the code.One moment where something finally ""clicked"" was after my first mini project. In this project, I created a dynamic Replit App that helped calculate the time value of money and considered the implications of this. I found the project to be more enjoyable and manageable than I first thought it would be. This project really helped me see how capable and qualified I was to do things that I previously thought were impossible for me to do, such as technology projects, coding, and finance problems. This was a foundational building block moment for me where I really felt myself grow.As I've mentioned, I've changed a lot throughout this semester. I've found that I am a lot more capable than I ever thought possible, especially when it comes to solving complex problems. I've learned how to be the driver of AI - that it truly isn't AI doing the work, but me driving AI to do the work. I've learned how uncertainty isn't something to be scared of or avoided, but it is a challenge and opportunity to grow and flourish. Driving AI to help close this uncertainty gap is key. I will carry a lot forward from this experience. I have a lot of takeaways about how to drive AI to help solve complex problems and conduct analyses. I have learned a lot about how to utilize AI, and I will carry this knowledge and experience on into my future. I will continue to drive AI to help solve problems and close the gap between what I know and what I need to know to solve problems."
