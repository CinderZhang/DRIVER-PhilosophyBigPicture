# DRIVER Framework Update: Define & Discover Enhancement

## Executive Summary

The DRIVER framework evolves from "Discover & Design" to "Define & Discover", creating clearer, more actionable first steps that better prepare students for systematic problem-solving with AI.

## The Enhanced Framework: D-R-I-V-E-R

### D - Define & Discover: The Critical First Step

#### Define: What exactly am I trying to solve?
**Core Questions**:
- What's the specific question or problem?
- What would a successful answer/solution look like?
- What are the constraints (time, resources, data)?
- What are the boundaries of this problem?

**Implementation in Practice**:
- Start with problem statement clarification
- Establish success criteria upfront
- Identify non-negotiable requirements
- Set clear scope boundaries

**Example (Session 1 Assignment)**:
```
Define Phase:
- "I need to calculate 5 specific financial ratios for one company"
- "Success = ratios that match financial websites within 2% margin"
- "Constraints = must use Python, real data from yfinance, complete in 15 minutes"
- "Boundaries = one company, current year data only"
```

#### Discover: What do I know vs. need to learn?
**Core Questions**:
- What do I already understand about this problem?
- What knowledge gaps exist?
- Where can I find what I need?
- What assumptions am I making?

**Implementation in Practice**:
- Knowledge inventory assessment
- Gap analysis identification
- Resource location planning
- Assumption documentation

**Example (Session 1 Assignment)**:
```
Discover Phase:
- "I know: what ROA means conceptually, basic Python syntax"
- "I don't know: yfinance API structure, exact data field names"
- "I need to learn: which financial statement items map to ratio components"
- "Resources: yfinance documentation, course materials, AI for clarification"
```

### Why This Change Improves Learning

#### 1. Clearer Mental Model
**Before**: "Discover & Design" created overlap - discovering often felt like designing
**After**: "Define & Discover" creates sequential clarity - first understand the problem, then understand what you need

#### 2. Better AI Partnership Preparation
Students who clearly define problems and discover gaps use AI more effectively:
- More precise prompts ("Help me understand how yfinance stores revenue data")
- Better validation ("Does this match my success criteria?")
- Strategic assistance ("I know X, help me learn Y")

#### 3. Reduced Cognitive Overload
Breaking the first stage into two distinct activities:
- **Define** = Problem space (external focus)
- **Discover** = Knowledge space (internal focus)

This separation helps students tackle one cognitive challenge at a time.

#### 4. Professional Alignment
This mirrors real-world problem-solving:
1. Define the business problem clearly
2. Discover what resources/knowledge you have vs. need
3. Then move to representation and implementation

### Integration with Remaining DRIVER Stages

The enhanced Define & Discover foundation strengthens all subsequent stages:

**R - Represent**: With clear problem definition and knowledge gaps identified, representation becomes more targeted

**I - Implement**: Implementation is more efficient when you've discovered exactly what you need to learn

**V - Verify**: Verification criteria were established in Define, making this stage more objective

**E - Evolve**: Evolution builds on a solid foundation of well-defined problems

**R - Reflect**: Reflection includes how well you defined and discovered, not just what you built

### Implementation Guidelines for Educators

#### In Session Design
```markdown
## Section 4: Apply the DRIVER Framework

### Stage 1: Define & Discover (25 minutes)

**Define the Problem** (10 minutes)
ðŸ¤– AI Copilot: Use AI to help clarify requirements, not solve them

Example Prompts for Define:
- "Help me break down this problem statement into specific requirements"
- "What success criteria should I establish for [specific task]?"
- "What constraints should I consider for this problem?"

**Discover Your Gaps** (15 minutes)
ðŸ¤– AI Copilot: Use AI to identify learning needs, not bypass them

Example Prompts for Discover:
- "What concepts do I need to understand to solve this?"
- "Where can I find information about [specific topic]?"
- "What's the difference between [concept A] and [concept B]?"
```

#### In Assignments
```markdown
## Video Assignment Requirements

Your video must demonstrate all DRIVER stages, starting with:

1. **Define & Discover (3-4 minutes)**
   - Clearly state the problem you're solving
   - Explain your success criteria
   - Identify what you knew vs. had to learn
   - Show how you found necessary information
```

### Student Benefits

#### Immediate Benefits
- Less confusion about where to start
- More structured approach to using AI help
- Clearer progression through problem-solving
- Better self-assessment of readiness

#### Long-term Benefits
- Develops systematic thinking habits
- Builds problem decomposition skills
- Creates knowledge gap awareness
- Improves learning efficiency

### Migration Strategy

#### For Existing Materials
1. Update all "Discover & Design" references to "Define & Discover"
2. Add explicit Define prompts before Discover prompts
3. Adjust time allocations (Define: 40%, Discover: 60% of first stage)
4. Update rubrics to assess problem definition quality

#### For New Materials
1. Start with Define & Discover as the foundation
2. Include both aspects in every session
3. Create progressively complex definition challenges
4. Build discovery skills systematically

### Examples Across Difficulty Levels

#### Beginner (Financial Management)
**Define**: "Calculate working capital for Apple"
- Specific: Current assets minus current liabilities
- Success: Matches published financial statements
- Constraint: Use latest 10-K data

**Discover**: 
- Know: Basic accounting equation
- Need: How to read 10-K, where to find data
- Learn: SEC EDGAR navigation

#### Intermediate (Financial Modeling)
**Define**: "Build DCF model for Tesla valuation"
- Specific: 5-year projection with terminal value
- Success: Follows industry standard methodology
- Constraint: Defendable assumptions only

**Discover**:
- Know: Time value of money concepts
- Need: Industry growth rates, WACC calculation
- Learn: Comparable company analysis

#### Advanced (Investment)
**Define**: "Construct optimal portfolio with constraints"
- Specific: 10 assets, maximize Sharpe, ESG limits
- Success: Beats benchmark risk-adjusted returns
- Constraint: Transaction costs, regulatory limits

**Discover**:
- Know: Modern portfolio theory
- Need: Optimization algorithms, ESG data sources
- Learn: Constraint programming techniques

### Assessment Rubric Update

#### Define (New - 15% of grade)
- **Excellent (15%)**: Crystal clear problem statement with measurable success criteria
- **Good (12%)**: Clear problem with some success metrics
- **Adequate (9%)**: Problem stated but success criteria vague
- **Needs Work (6%)**: Unclear problem definition

#### Discover (Modified - 15% of grade)
- **Excellent (15%)**: Comprehensive gap analysis with clear learning plan
- **Good (12%)**: Identifies main gaps and resources
- **Adequate (9%)**: Some gaps identified, resources unclear
- **Needs Work (6%)**: Minimal gap awareness shown

### Conclusion

The shift from "Discover & Design" to "Define & Discover" isn't just semantic - it's a fundamental improvement in how students approach problems. By explicitly separating problem definition from knowledge discovery, we create clearer mental models, better AI partnerships, and stronger learning outcomes.

This enhancement maintains the spirit of DRIVER while making it more concrete and actionable for students at all levels. The framework remains flexible enough for creative adaptation while providing stronger scaffolding for systematic thinking development.
