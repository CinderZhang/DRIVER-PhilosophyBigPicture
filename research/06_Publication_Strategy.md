# Publication Strategy: Paper Pipeline and Journal Targets

**Document Created**: December 3, 2025
**Part of**: DRIVER Research Program
**Purpose**: Strategic plan for converting DRIVER research into academic publications

---

## Part I: Strategic Overview

### 1.1 Publication Goals

**Primary Goal**: Establish DRIVER as a rigorous academic contribution, not just a teaching methodology.

**Secondary Goals**:
- Build research reputation in AI + education/work intersection
- Create foundation for future grants and collaborations
- Generate evidence base for broader DRIVER adoption
- Position Dr. Zhang for academic career advancement

### 1.2 The Four-Paper Strategy

The DRIVER dataset can support multiple papers targeting different audiences:

| Paper | Focus | Primary Audience | Target Tier |
|-------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| Paper 1 | Main intervention effects | Finance/Management | Top-tier |
| Paper 2 | Mechanisms (who adapts?) | Organization/HRM | Top-tier |
| Paper 3 | Cognitive development | Education/Learning | Top-tier |
| Paper 4 | Career outcomes | Labor Economics | Top-tier |

### 1.3 Why Multiple Papers?

- **Different literatures**: Each paper speaks to a distinct scholarly conversation
- **Different methodologies**: Main effects vs. mediation vs. trajectories
- **Different implications**: Training, individual differences, cognitive science, labor markets
- **Strategic positioning**: Demonstrates breadth while building depth

---

## Part II: Paper 1 - Primary Intervention Study

### 2.1 Paper Concept

**Title**: *"Human Capital Development in AI-Augmented Financial Analysis: Evidence from a Structured Intervention"*

**Core Question**: Does structured AI collaboration build analytical capabilities or create dependency?

**Key Contribution**: First systematic evidence on intervention effects with both cognitive and labor market outcomes.

### 2.2 Abstract Draft

> "We study how financial professionals develop expertise when AI can perform expert-level analytical tasks. Using data from a structured intervention (DRIVER) deployed with 280+ participants, we find that structured AI collaboration builds analytical capabilities rather than creating dependency. Treatment effects are concentrated among participants who develop 'AI as partner' rather than 'AI as oracle' mental models. Students in DRIVER sections show 0.X SD higher independent performance (without AI) and 100% placement rate versus X% for traditional sections. These findings suggest that training design—not mere AI exposure—determines whether AI augments or undermines human capital."

### 2.3 Target Journals

**Tier 1 (First Submission)**:
- **Management Science**: Published similar training interventions; methodologically rigorous; broad readership
- **Journal of Financial Economics**: If positioning as labor market/information production

**Tier 2 (If Tier 1 Rejected)**:
- **Strategic Management Journal**: Organizational implications
- **Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis**: Finance focus

**Tier 3 (If Tier 2 Rejected)**:
- **Finance Research Letters**: Shorter format, faster turnaround
- **Journal of Corporate Finance**: Applied finance audience

### 2.4 Positioning for Management Science

**Why Management Science?**:
- Published Karlan & Valdivia (microenterprise training)
- Published Brynjolfsson et al. (IT and productivity)
- Methodological rigor valued
- Broad impact across disciplines

**Key Angles to Emphasize**:
1. Field experiment design (even if quasi-experimental)
2. Causal identification strategy
3. Practical implications for organizations
4. Novel measurement innovation (unplugged assessment)

### 2.5 Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data collection complete | Month 4 (T2) |
| Analysis complete | Month 6 |

---

## Part III: Paper 2 - Mechanism Study

### 3.1 Paper Concept

**Title**: *"Who Adapts to AI? Individual Differences in Human-AI Collaboration Skill Development"*

**Core Question**: What predicts successful adaptation versus resistance to AI partnership?

**Key Contribution**: Identifies moderators and mediators of AI training effectiveness.

### 3.2 Abstract Draft

> "As organizations adopt AI tools, a critical question emerges: what predicts who adapts successfully versus who struggles or resists? Using longitudinal data from an AI-integrated professional training program, we identify key individual differences that moderate intervention effectiveness. Deep learning orientation amplifies training benefits (β = X.XX), while technology anxiety attenuates them (β = -X.XX). Prompt engineering skill development and metacognitive awareness mediate the intervention effect on capability building. These findings suggest organizations should tailor AI training approaches based on individual learning styles and provide targeted support for high-anxiety individuals."

### 3.3 Target Journals

**Tier 1**:
- **Organization Science**: Individual-level organizational phenomena
- **Academy of Management Journal**: Empirical rigor, broad impact

**Tier 2**:
- **Journal of Applied Psychology**: Individual differences, training
- **Personnel Psychology**: HR/training focus

**Tier 3**:
- **Human Resource Management**: Practitioner relevance
- **Journal of Organizational Behavior**: Micro-organizational

### 3.4 Positioning for Organization Science

**Why Organization Science?**:
- Focus on individual-level phenomena in organizations

## Part IV: Paper 3 - Cognitive Development Study

### 4.1 Paper Concept

**Title**: *"From Oracle to Partner: Tracking Mental Model Evolution in AI-Augmented Learning"*

**Core Question**: How do mental models of AI partnership evolve over time with structured training?

**Key Contribution**: New validated scale; trajectory analysis of cognitive development; integration of qualitative and quantitative evidence.

### 4.2 Abstract Draft

> "How do learners' mental models of AI evolve from naive to sophisticated? We develop and validate a new scale measuring AI Mental Model sophistication and track its evolution across a semester-long AI-integrated curriculum. Using latent growth modeling, we identify three distinct trajectories: rapid adopters (X%), gradual developers (X%), and persistent resisters (X%). Trajectory membership predicts independent performance: rapid adopters show highest capability without AI access. Qualitative data reveal the cognitive shift from 'AI as answer machine' to 'AI as thinking partner.' These findings contribute a validated measurement tool and theoretical framework for studying human adaptation to AI collaboration."

### 4.3 Target Journals

**Tier 1**:
- **Journal of Educational Psychology**: Learning and instruction focus

## Part V: Paper 4 - Career Outcomes Study

### 5.1 Paper Concept

**Title**: *"Does AI Training Pay? Labor Market Returns to Structured AI Collaboration Skills"*

**Core Question**: Do graduates with systematic AI training achieve better career outcomes?

**Key Contribution**: First evidence linking AI training intervention to labor market returns.

### 5.2 Abstract Draft

> "As AI transforms professional work, employers increasingly value AI collaboration skills—but does systematic AI training translate to labor market advantage? Using 6-month follow-up data from graduates of an AI-integrated finance curriculum, we find DRIVER-trained students achieve X% higher placement rates and $X,XXX higher starting salaries compared to traditionally-trained peers. Effects are strongest in finance roles requiring analytical judgment. Salary premiums persist after controlling for GPA, major, and pre-treatment capabilities. These findings suggest substantial returns to structured AI training and have implications for educational investment and workforce development policy."
