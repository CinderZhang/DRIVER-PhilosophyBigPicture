# Archive: Earlier Research Drafts

**Purpose**: This folder contains earlier draft documents that have been superseded by the comprehensive research documents in the parent `/research/` folder.

## Archived Files

| File | Description | Superseded By |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `DRIVER_Academic_Research_Design.md` | Initial comprehensive research design | `00_Research_Master_Plan.md` + domain-specific documents |
| `DRIVER_Survey_Instruments.md` | Initial survey instrument draft | `04_Survey_Instruments.md` (more complete) |

## Why Archived (Not Deleted)

These documents represent valuable early thinking in the research design process. They are preserved for:
- Reference to original conceptualization
- Tracking intellectual evolution of the research program
- Potential recovery of any elements not captured in final documents
