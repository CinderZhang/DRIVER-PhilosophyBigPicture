**Problem Type 2: Bond Valuation**
A bond has a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 6% (paid annually), and 10 years to maturity. If the market interest rate is 5%, what is the bond's price? Explain your reasoning.

**Problem Type 3: Stock Valuation**

**Instructions:** For each AI-generated solution below, rate your confidence in its accuracy (1-10) and identify any errors or limitations.

*[6 problems will be presented: 2 correct, 2 with math errors, 2 with reasoning errors]*

**Example Problem:**
"AI was asked to calculate the present value of $50,000 received in 10 years at 6% interest."

AI Response: "Using the present value formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, we get: PV = $50,000 / (1.06)^10 = $50,000 / 1.7908 = $27,919.74"
