## Section D2: AI Output Evaluation Task (AOET)

### Instructions

"You will review 6 AI-generated solutions to financial problems. For each:
1. Rate your confidence that the solution is correct (1-10)
2. Identify whether it is Correct, Incorrect, or you are Unsure
3. If incorrect, explain the error
4. Describe how you would verify this solution

Some solutions are correct; others contain errors. Take your time—accuracy is more important than speed."

### AOET Problem 1 (CORRECT)

**Question asked to AI:** "What is the present value of $10,000 received 5 years from now if the discount rate is 8%?"

**AI Response:**
"To find the present value, we use the formula: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n

Where:
- FV = $10,000 (future value)
- r = 0.08 (8% discount rate)
- n = 5 (years)

Calculation:
PV = $10,000 / (1.08)^5
PV = $10,000 / 1.4693
PV = $6,805.83

The present value is $6,805.83."

**Your Response:**

Confidence (1-10): _____

This solution is:  [ ] Correct  [ ] Incorrect  [ ] Unsure

If incorrect, explain the error:

### AOET Problem 2 (INCORRECT - Math Error)

**Question asked to AI:** "Calculate the monthly payment on a $200,000 mortgage at 6% annual interest for 30 years."

**AI Response:**
"Using the mortgage payment formula:
M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
- P = $200,000 (principal)
- r = 0.06/12 = 0.005 (monthly rate)
- n = 30 × 12 = 360 (total payments)

Calculation:
M = $200,000 × [0.005(1.005)^360] / [(1.005)^360 - 1]
M = $200,000 × [0.005 × 6.023] / [6.023 - 1]
M = $200,000 × 0.03011 / 5.023
M = $200,000 × 0.00599
M = $1,198.00

The monthly payment is $1,198.00."

*[Note: Correct answer is approximately $1,199.10; the AI made a rounding error in intermediate steps]*

**Your Response:**

Confidence (1-10): _____

This solution is:  [ ] Correct  [ ] Incorrect  [ ] Unsure

If incorrect, explain the error:

### AOET Problem 3 (CORRECT)

**Question asked to AI:** "Should I invest in a bond with a 5% coupon if market interest rates are 6%?"

**AI Response:**
"When market interest rates (6%) exceed the bond's coupon rate (5%), the bond will trade at a discount (below face value).

Here's why:
1. A $1,000 bond with 5% coupon pays $50 annually
2. New bonds in the market pay 6% ($60 annually for same $1,000)
3. To be competitive, your 5% bond must drop in price
4. At a lower price, the $50 payment represents a higher yield to new buyers

**Investment considerations:**
- If you buy at discount and hold to maturity, you'll receive full face value (capital gain)
- Total return = coupon payments + capital appreciation
- Compare to alternative investments at 6%
- Consider your investment horizon and risk tolerance

Whether to invest depends on your specific goals, but the bond's discount means the market views it as less attractive than current alternatives."

**Your Response:**

Confidence (1-10): _____

This solution is:  [ ] Correct  [ ] Incorrect  [ ] Unsure

### AOET Problem 4 (INCORRECT - Reasoning Error)

**Question asked to AI:** "Is a company with a P/E ratio of 50 overvalued?"

**AI Response:**
"Yes, a P/E ratio of 50 indicates the company is significantly overvalued.

A P/E ratio of 50 means investors are paying $50 for every $1 of earnings. The historical average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is around 15-16. Therefore, a P/E of 50 is more than 3 times the market average.

**Signs of overvaluation:**
- P/E of 50 means it would take 50 years of current earnings to pay back your investment
- Market average is 15-16, so this company is 3x more expensive
- Unless earnings are expected to grow substantially, this price is not justified

**Recommendation:** Avoid this stock as it is clearly overvalued."

*[Note: This reasoning is flawed—P/E alone doesn't determine overvaluation without considering growth expectations, industry comparisons, and other factors]*

**Your Response:**

Confidence (1-10): _____

This solution is:  [ ] Correct  [ ] Incorrect  [ ] Unsure

If incorrect, explain the error:

### AOET Problem 5 (INCORRECT - Math Error)

**Question asked to AI:** "What is the expected return of a portfolio that is 60% stocks (expected return 10%) and 40% bonds (expected return 4%)?"

**AI Response:**
"Portfolio Expected Return = (Weight_stocks × Return_stocks) + (Weight_bonds × Return_bonds)

Calculation:
= (0.60 × 0.10) + (0.40 × 0.04)
= 0.06 + 0.016
= 0.076 or 7.6%

Wait, let me recalculate:
= (60% × 10%) + (40% × 4%)
= 6% + 1.6%
= 6.6%

The expected portfolio return is 6.6%."

*[Note: First calculation was correct at 7.6%; the AI incorrectly "corrected" itself]*

**Your Response:**

Confidence (1-10): _____

This solution is:  [ ] Correct  [ ] Incorrect  [ ] Unsure

If incorrect, explain the error:

### AOET Problem 6 (INCORRECT - Reasoning Error)

**Question asked to AI:** "Which is a better investment: Stock A with 15% expected return and 20% standard deviation, or Stock B with 12% expected return and 10% standard deviation?"

**AI Response:**
"Stock A is the better investment because it has a higher expected return (15% vs 12%).

While Stock B has lower risk (10% vs 20% standard deviation), the additional 3% return from Stock A more than compensates for the additional risk.

**Comparison:**
- Stock A: 15% return, 20% risk = clearly superior
- Stock B: 12% return, 10% risk = inferior option

Risk is important, but ultimately investors are trying to maximize returns. Stock A provides higher returns and should be selected."

*[Note: This ignores risk-adjusted returns, individual risk tolerance, Sharpe ratios, and portfolio context]*

**Your Response:**

Confidence (1-10): _____

This solution is:  [ ] Correct  [ ] Incorrect  [ ] Unsure

If incorrect, explain the error:
